Here’s one that I missed the first time around: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2018/02/russian-hacks-effective-terrible-reporting-practices&quot;&gt;The Russian Hacks Were Effective Because of Terrible Reporting Practices&lt;/a&gt;. LGM’s Scott Lemieux quotes James Risen’s account of Russian interference in the 2016 election:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There can be little doubt now that Russian intelligence officials were behind an effort to hack the DNC’s computers and steal emails and other information from aides to Hillary Clinton as a means of damaging her presidential campaign. Once they stole the correspondence, Russian intelligence officials used cutouts and fronts to launder the emails and get them into the bloodstream of the U.S. press. Russian intelligence also used fake social media accounts and other tools to create a global echo chamber both for stories about the emails and for anti-Clinton lies dressed up to look like news.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To their disgrace, editors and reporters at American news organizations greatly enhanced the Russian echo chamber, eagerly writing stories about Clinton and the Democratic Party based on the emails, while showing almost no interest during the presidential campaign in exactly how those emails came to be disclosed and distributed. The Intercept itself has faced such accusations. The hack was a much more important story than the content of the emails themselves, but that story was largely ignored because it was so easy for journalists to write about Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do note that The Intercept is the outlet publishing Risen’s story; he’s not randomly calling out one publication. This leads to Lemieux’s broader point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But hacks alone can’t influence elections. Media coverage of hacks can influence elections, and lessons from the 2016 campaign need to be learned:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Note that the leaks were released in a very careful strategic fashion, designed to to maximum political damage — for example, during the DNC, or the day of the Billy Bush tapes. This should have caused the media to be extremely skeptical about the way the leaks were framed and very careful not to advance the narratives of people obviously trying to ratfuck the elections. It didn’t — quite the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a fundamental tension of interests here: on the one hand, you have almost a collective action problem. The constant leaking of DNC and Podesta emails went on for months, and every day was a new opportunity to cover an ongoing story for an insatiable public. If the Washington Post (or The Intercept) just decided not to cover any of it, the news is still out there and being covered by everyone else. Really, these email leaks were fundamentally newsworthy—for more reasons than we understood at the time—and it’s the job of the press to report the news. It’s absurd to suggest that the press would just… ignore them. On the other hand, the breathless coverage carried a lot of water for foreign intellligence operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Lemieux ultimately suggests is coverage that spends more time examining the motives of the leakers, and less time pretending the emails revealed some material misconduct by the DNC and Podesta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2018 midterm elections are just about 240 days away. If the federal government doesn’t take affirmative steps to discourage foreign meddling this time around, it’s easy to imagine there will be a lot of strategically leaked emails in the news. Here’s hoping the press handles the do-over better than in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Lawyers, Guns &amp;amp; Money is one of my favorite blogs because you don’t spend a lot of time wondering what the premises of their posts are.

This makes it kind of hard for police to figure out whose gun they just found at a crime scene. Jeanne Marie Laskas in GQ wrote the definitive profile of the unbelievable story of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/inside-federal-bureau-of-way-too-many-guns&quot;&gt;How the Cops Actually Trace a Gun&lt;/a&gt;. It’s impossible to summarize, but let’s start at the beginning, with a hypothetical murder scene:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, take that murder we began with. Blood all over the place, cops looking for clues, the booties. They find the gun! What happens next does not involve the wizardry of some supercomputer somewhere. It hinges on a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That cop with the gun dangling from his pinkie. He dials the tracing center and describes the gun. This is Step One. Let’s say, for example, he reports that he’s got a 9-mm semi-automatic Beretta 92.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​On the other end of that phone is someone like the ATF’s Scott Hester. The problem is that the police aren’t firearms experts, so when a detective finds a Beretta 92 handgun at a crime scene, it might not actually be a Beretta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He’s holding a hefty book, one of his favorite gun encyclopedias, and he would like to tell me about the Beretta 92 and its various doppelgängers. “Now, the real Beretta’s made in Italy,” he says, “but Taurus is made in Brazil. So you have the Beretta 92 and Taurus PT 92. They’re the exact same gun except the safety’s on the slide on one and on the frame of the other.” I want to tell him it doesn’t matter—I was just picking any random gun so he could walk me through the steps about how to trace it—but it occurs to me that his entire career is built on the premise that, yes, it matters. “Now, Beretta was licensing its stuff in Brazil,” he goes on, “but Taurus bought it out, so they bought up Brazil—Beretta’s factory in Brazil—and licensed it as Taurus.” He’s pointing to a page in the book, tapping hard as if the force of the tap will make this any easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that the only person who seems more frustrated by the situation than the ATF agent is the reporter, who just wants to know what happens when an officer calls about a particular gun. The fact that there are absolutely no easy answers is a theme that occurs again and again in this excellently written story. Laskas eventually manages to move the conversation along. What happens when you identify the model of gun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I need the serial number,” Hester says. He lifts his shoulders in an exaggerated shrug and lets out an ominous sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Serial numbers: not so simple. “It gets worse and worse, more and more problematic.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Serial numbers, it turns out, are tangled clogs of hell. Half the time what the cop is reading you is the patent number, not the serial number, or it’s the ID of the importer, and then you have the “zero versus letter O” problem, the “numeral 1 versus letter l versus letter small-cap I” problem, and then there is the matter of all the guns with duplicate serial numbers (various Chinese guns, certain pre-1968 American guns).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Okay?” Hester says, in a pleading sort of way. The number one reason gun traces go dry is because the cop got the gun description or the serial number wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I tell him I need to move on. I could never work here. I tell him let’s pretend there’s a miracle and we definitely know we have a Taurus PT 92 and it has a legible serial number.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We may now move on to Step Two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sisyphean seems like an understatement, but incredibly, these people have upwards of a 90% success rate in the face of what ought to be insurmountable obstacles. That particular number comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/255517926&quot;&gt;wonderful short documentary&lt;/a&gt; on this process.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Over the next two days, journalists and misinformation researchers uncovered and tweeted still more examples of fake news and conspiracy theories propagating in the aftermath of the tragedy. The New York Times’ John Herrman found pages of conspiratorial YouTube videos with hundreds of thousands of views, many of them highly ranked in search returns. Cale Weissman at Fast Company noticed that Facebook’s crisis response page was surfacing news stories from alt-right blogs and sites like End Time Headlines rife with false information. I tracked how YouTube’s recommendation engine allows users to stumble down an algorithm-powered conspiracy video rabbit hole. In each instance, the journalists reported their findings to the platforms. And in each instance, the platforms apologized, claimed they were unaware of the content, promised to improve, and removed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that paragraph could just as easily have been written in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting, or the Aurora movie theater shooting, or the Sandy Hook shooting, or whatever the next mass shooting will be. Which is kind of Warzel’s point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All of this raises a mind-bendingly simple question that YouTube, Google, Twitter, and Facebook have not yet answered: How is it that the average untrained human can do something that multi-billion dollar technology companies that pride themselves on innovation cannot? And beyond that, why is it that — after multiple national tragedies politicized by malicious hoaxes and misinformation — such a question even needs to be asked?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Look, of course Google and Facebook and Twitter can’t monitor all of the content on their platforms posted by their billions of users. Nor does anyone really expect them to. But policing what’s taking off and trending as it relates to the news of the day is another matter. Clearly, it can be done because people are already doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, if a handful of Buzzfeed’s reporters can flag this in near real-time for free, surely Facebook and YouTube can hire a dozen folks to watch stuff trend and flag it.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006&quot;&gt;Heck, Facebook used to have exactly that thing&lt;/a&gt;. It worked great, except for the part where the conspiracy theorists complained that Facebook unfairly blocked right-wing conspiracy theories from trending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at NYU, has called this phenomenon the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/&quot;&gt;View From Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;”. Rosen coined this term in 2003, when there was no Facebook; it originally applied to things like the New York Times’s coverage of the run-up to the Iraq War. But here, when Facebook fired the team of people meant to keep the Trending Stories algorithm from promoting conspiracy theories, I see the View From Nowhere striking again. Facebook fired its team because its team couldn’t suppress as many left-wing conspiracy theories as right-wing conspiracy theories. That means that either Facebook hired a bunch of liberal ideologues who brought their politics to work every day, or conspiracy theories find more traction in conservative media than liberal media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t new, either. Toward the end of his first term, President Obama famously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-tomasky-on-obamas-delusions-about-the-gops-fever-breaking&quot;&gt;predicted the Republican fever would break&lt;/a&gt; during his second term.

Then, sharply different choices.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know much about Bob Mueller before this (he was on a high school ice hockey team with John F. Kerry?!), and this is a fascinating glimpse into his upbringing and career. For my money, the way Fisher and Horwitz contrast Mueller and Trump even as young men is the most entertaining part of this whole thing. For example, this episode from Trump’s military school tenure as Captain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Promoted to captain of A Company, Trump won respect from some of the other boys, who said they never wanted to disappoint him. Trump introduced them to a world of fun, setting up a tanning salon in his dorm room, bringing beautiful women to campus and leading the baseball team to victory.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But other cadets said Trump tried to break boys who didn’t bend to his will. During Trump’s senior year, when one of his sergeants shoved a new cadet against a wall for not standing at attention quickly enough, Trump was relieved of his duty in the barracks, said Lee Ains, the student who was shoved.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Trump denied being demoted, saying he was actually moved up. “You don’t get elevated if you partake in hazing,” he told The Post in 2016. He was put in charge of a drill team that would perform in New York City’s Columbus Day Parade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is immediately followed by a smash cut to Second Lieutenant Bob Mueller’s tour of duty in Vietnam:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mutter’s Ridge was a killing ground, a craggy hellscape in Quang Tri province where the Marines had been fighting for years, setting up and abandoning bases as they tried over and over to assert control of one of the main routes the North Vietnamese used to infiltrate the South.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Year after year, the ridge, hard by the demilitarized zone that separated North from South, was the scene of fierce assaults, fleeting victories and fiery retreats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;On Dec. 11, 1968, Mueller led a platoon of Marines into an eight-hour battle around an extensive complex of North Vietnamese army bunkers. The enemy hit Mueller’s men with a “heavy volume of small arms, automatic weapons, and grenade launcher fire,” according to a Marine Corps account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the editorial contrast here. Apart from noting that Trump applied for and received five draft deferments during the Vietnam War, that’s about as far as Fisher and Horwitz explicitly take the comparison. Also worth noting, this profile was published before Trump’s absurd remarks about how he’d personally storm into a school shooting. It’s just a coincidence that this impeachment of his character appeared in the Post around the same time as his macho posturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Washington Posts’s Marc Fisher and Sari Horwitz published a pair of profiles on two of the people at the center of the biggest political scandal in a generation, titled Mueller and Trump: Born to wealth, raised to lead.

It’s just a coincidence that this impeachment of his character appeared in the Post around the same time as his macho posturing.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lady Doritos, Spherical Cows, and Democracy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/post/lady-doritos-spherical-cows-democracy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lady Doritos, Spherical Cows, and Democracy" /><published>2018-02-23T18:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-02-23T18:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post/lady-doritos-spherical-cows-democracy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/post/lady-doritos-spherical-cows-democracy/">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I posted my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dominicmauro/status/964178059434909697&quot;&gt;15,000th tweet&lt;/a&gt; since I first signed up for Twitter in July 2007. Back then, it was called Twttr, and there were no hashtags or @mentions conventions. The homepage was a live stream of every single tweet, and a loaf of bread cost only a nickel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the decade since, a lot of things have changed about Twitter. For one, the risk of nuclear war being set off via a tweet has increased enormously. For another, there are a lot more people on Twitter. Bread also costs more. But what really strikes me about social media—Twitter and everything else—is that it seems like the same conversation over and over again. Sure, the conversations are &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; new things, but isn’t it always the same conversation? Something happens, and you’re either for it or against it, but you’re mad either way because you can’t believe half the country is against it or for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this year’s The Super Bowl, The Outline’s Alex Nichols explored the unseemly parentage of some of these conversations in a piece titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/3328/lady-doritos-controversy-outrage-marketing&quot;&gt;Lady Doritos, the patron saint of outrage marketing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These brief ping-pong games of feigned outrage can be entertaining, but they ultimately accomplish nothing. Each side digs in its heels until the discussion becomes a parody of itself. The only appreciable effect of any given micro-controversy is that the phrase in question — whether it be “well-done steak,” “shithole countries,” or “covfefe” — sees a brief uptick in search traffic and appears organically in millions of users’ feeds. This proposition is undoubtedly highly attractive to advertisers, who normally have to fork over $200,000 to get something trending on Twitter. Here’s my theory: corporate marketing departments are setting out to hijack this process, thus accomplishing the same thing — but for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set aside the tedium in endless cycles of (genuine, but nonetheless) performative outrage. It’s hard to argue with Nichols’s theory. I mean, I’ve been convinced for a while that &lt;a href=&quot;https://duckduckgo.com/?q=urban+outfitters+controversy&quot;&gt;Urban Outfitters’s marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt; seems to revolve around a bimonthly outrage. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This week it was “Lady Doritos.” In an interview on the Freakonomics podcast (which I was upset to learn exists) PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi suggested that the chip division of her company was developing a cleaner, less crunchy Dorito variety aimed at women. As is the internet’s wont, Nooyi’s comments were wildly misconstrued and became a flashpoint for Twitter hysteria. “Lady Doritos” were never actually going to be a real thing, and PepsiCo walked back the suggestion within a day with an incredible tweet: “We already have Doritos for women — they’re called Doritos, and they’re loved by millions.” Truer words were never spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come for the PepsiCo malarkey, stay for Disney’s PR firm making sure everyone knows there’s a pirate version of The Last Jedi with all the women edited out. I really like Nichols’s reporting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sidebar:&lt;/em&gt; Really, what did the outrage and teeth-gnashing accomplish? It’s bad enough that we had another stupid argument online about Lady Doritos or Daisy Ridley. But a thing that was never going to happen didn’t happen, and a lot of people angrily tweeted in agreement and/or disagreement with one another. I can’t escape the feeling that I’m participating in the Outrage Culture Wars with every tweet. Every 140 characters is a window of opportunity for millions of strangers to angrily shriek their approval or disapproval at the values I’ve signaled. Heck, even the fact that tweets are 280 characters instead of 140 is a chance for people to take sides. Wading through these cesspools wondering how much of the panic has purposefully engineered to sell more corn chips or movie tickets is just… awful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-it-gets-worse&quot;&gt;But It Gets Worse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reflection, having Disney and Pepsi game the system might be one of the better cases. At least they’re only gaslighting you into buying something. The algorithms powering social media seem to prefer hoaxes and conspiracy theories over reality, as the Guardian’s Paul Lewis reported on a software program that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth&quot;&gt;catalogs what YouTube’s algorithm shows users&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The software [Former YouTube Engineer Guillaume] Chaslot wrote was designed to provide the world’s first window into YouTube’s opaque recommendation engine. The program simulates the behaviour of a user who starts on one video and then follows the chain of recommended videos – much as I did after watching the Logan Paul video – tracking data along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Over the last 18 months, Chaslot has used the program to explore bias in YouTube content promoted during the French, British and German elections, global warming and mass shootings, and published his findings on his website, Algotransparency.com. Each study finds something different, but the research suggests YouTube systematically amplifies videos that are divisive, sensational and conspiratorial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When his program found a seed videos by the searching the query “who is Michelle Obama?” and then followed the chain of “up next” suggestions, for example, most of the recommended videos said she “is a man”. More than 80% of the YouTube-recommended videos about the pope detected by his program described the Catholic leader as “evil”, “satanic”, or “the anti-Christ”. There were literally millions of videos uploaded to YouTube to satiate the algorithm’s appetite for content claiming the earth is flat. “On YouTube, fiction is outperforming reality,” Chaslot says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, YouTube can’t really control what its users upload. That’s one of the big ideas behind social media, right? People make the content, and other people follow channels of content that they like, and media gets democratized. My tweets are on even footing with CBS News: I don’t need a network of radio and television affiliates or a web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, YouTube &lt;strong&gt;can control&lt;/strong&gt; what its users see. There’s something like a hundred hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. There’s literally no way to watch it all. YouTube is going to recommend some videos over others, but I can’t stand networks like YouTube pretending to be passive systems. Even worse, by promoting videos claiming the earth is flat, YouTube is creating an incentive for people to &lt;em&gt;make more flat earth videos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to Lewis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Zeynep] Tufekci, the sociologist who several months ago warned about the impact YouTube may have had on the election, tells me YouTube’s recommendation system has probably figured out that edgy and hateful content s engaging. “This is a bit like an autopilot cafeteria in a school that has figured out children have sweet teeth, and also like fatty and salty foods,” she says. “So you make a line offering such food, automatically loading the next plate as soon as the bag of chips or candy in front of the young person has been consumed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Once that gets normalised, however, what is fractionally more edgy or bizarre becomes, Tufekci says, novel and interesting. “So the food gets higher and higher in sugar, fat and salt – natural human cravings – while the videos recommended and auto-played by YouTube get more and more bizarre or hateful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​If the cafeteria started serving chocolate-covered deep-fried Lady Doritos, parents (if not teachers) would understandably revolt. Tufecki’s one of the single best writers about this issue you can read. Note that her analogy relies on the duty of care the adults in the room owe the children. The school isn’t a passive system: it’s administered or at the very least regulated by the government to enrich the minds (and bodies) of its students. Unregulated networks like YouTube have no interest other than engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tufekci also asks the deeper question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But why would a bias toward ever more weird or divisive videos benefit one candidate over another? That depends on the candidates. Trump’s campaign was nothing if not weird and divisive. Tufekci points to studies showing that “field of misinformation” largely tilted anti-Clinton before the election. “Fake news providers,” she says, “found that fake anti-Clinton material played much better with the pro-Trump base than did fake anti-Trump material with the pro-Clinton base.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have to wonder why one party’s voters seem so much more susceptible to conspiracy theories and hoaxes than the other’s. There’s no left-wing equivalent to Fox News; nobody on MSNBC or CNN has spent the year breathlessly speculating on the Pee Tape the way Fox’s anchors endlessly entertained the idea that President Obama was not an American citizen. I’m not sure if that’s a cause or an effect. To be clear, there are groups of people who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 who also think President Bush Did 9/11 and so on, but those groups of people aren’t mainstream the way Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Alex Jones are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one-last-thought&quot;&gt;One Last Thought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me switch gears and come back to that in a second. There’s a famous quote that’s been attributed to just about every boxer since Jack Johnson that goes something like this: “Everyone has a strategy until they get punched in the face.” Any ideology or system of values ought to be able to interact with reality. There’s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow&quot;&gt;old joke&lt;/a&gt; about the dangers of overvaluing abstract thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia. A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place. The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader. Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, “I have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​A friend of mine with an education in economics once explained to me why he had little faith in capitalism. As an economic system, capitalism relies upon (1) consumers with perfect information who (2) make perfectly rational decisions and (3) perfectly efficient transactions. But of course, consumers are people, and people don’t even have perfect information about how irrational they are. Consumers likewise don’t have perfect information about what the rest of the economy is doing. Oh, and if you think transactions are perfectly efficient, I have a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who can sell you information on where to buy a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to worry that democracy is relying on spherical cows: human beings who live in the same reality. Back when there were three TV networks, and everyone watched the same nightly news reports, that worked more or less okay. But YouTube and Facebook’s algorithms feed us more and more outrageous and appalling content—whether it’s true or not—until we live in parallel universes. And I don’t think there are going to be fewer algorithms feeding us information in the future; there will probably be more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The other day, I posted my 15,000th tweet since I first signed up for Twitter in July 2007.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The CFPB is considered a powerful and independent watchdog. But many Republicans have wanted to shut it down since day one because they think it’s too powerful. [Acting CFPB Director] Mulvaney is one of them. As a Congressman, Mulvaney called the agency a “sick sad joke.” He drafted legislation to abolish it. So people at the bureau were shocked when the president appointed him to run this consumer protection agency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Within weeks of coming on board, Mulvaney has worked to make the watchdog agency less aggressive. […] In another move that particularly upset some staffers, the new boss also dropped a lawsuit against an alleged online loan shark called Golden Valley Lending. The suit says the lender illegally charges people up to 950 percent interest rates. It took CFPB staffers years to build the case. […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Mulvaney hasn’t officially offered details about why the case was dropped. Meanwhile, staffers at the bureau say they are worried Mulvaney will block more of their efforts to go after shady financial firms. He’s reviewing numerous ongoing lawsuits and investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this guy that runs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau doesn’t like the CFPB, and thinks consumers are already protected well enough. I think companies like Golden Valley shouldn’t be allowed to charge 950% interest. Reasonable minds can disagree, right? Well, this story isn’t as simple as “hey look another market Republicans don’t want to regulate,” although I do continue to be impressed at the breadth of that belief. Rather, the NPR article explains the other shifty things lenders like Golden Valley are doing, and introduces one of the debtors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For her part, Julie Bonenfant of Detroit still hasn’t paid off her debt to Golden Valley. And she feels “betrayed” by the president, whose appointee dropped the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“To be honest I’m really mad, really pissed, because I actually voted for Trump,” Bonenfant says. “So knowing that his guy threw out this case that affects people like me. I feel kind of like stupid — just kind of like betrayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder whether these sorts of profiles in buyers’ remorse over the 2016 election are productive or helpful in any way. On the one hand, actions have consequences and if you vote for someone whose policies are going to make your life worse, that’s kind of on you. Trump’s outlandish promises and visible lack of comprehension about just about every issue made him sound like a grifter on the campaign trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, who could have imagined the guy with the gold-plated Manhattan penthouse wouldn’t stand up for the little guy?&lt;/p&gt;

It was pretty clear that I didn’t understand the world that a lot of other people lived in. A big part of other peoples’ bubble seemed to be Facebook. While I check Facebook maybe three times a year, everyone I know checks it virtually daily. Immediately after the election, there was no shortage of accounts of how Facebook turned itself into a faulty news powerhouse, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://barelylegally.com/post/facebooked/&quot;&gt;I took some notes on my favorites&lt;/a&gt; mostly to order my own thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, just about a year into the Trump presidency, Facebook is getting itself out of the news business. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/facebooks-news-feed-change-is-a-retreat-from-the-public&quot;&gt;Charlie Warzel for Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In many ways, Facebook’s planned changes to News Feed are a retreat from the online public square the company helped create. They’re a tacit admission that the company’s great news experiment — which made it one of the most successful publishers in the world — failed. And now Facebook wants to go back to an idealized safe space, free of hyperpartisan pages, misinformation, and fake news. But when you’re home to nearly 2 billion humans, no change is ever simple; Facebook moved fast, broke things, and changed the way that the world produces, consumes, and shares information. And changing course more than a decade into one of the most disruptive social experiments ever might prove more than just a little difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Facebook is adjusting the algorithm to show fewer posts from Pages in favor of more posts from People. I suppose that’s a start, but what happens when People share propaganda from Pages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warzel continues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While it may cut down incidental exposure to misinformation, the changes could, in some cases, only harden filter bubbles with a steady stream of content from people with similar ideologies. Meanwhile, a retrenchment from News Feed into more walled-off Groups and communities could exacerbate exposure to misinformation. As one platform executive told BuzzFeed News, “the people who end up being chemtrailers or anti-vaxxers do so because of friend and community groups.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to one of Facebook’s executives, even if conspiracy theorists and agitprop outfits like “End The Fed” and the “George W Bush Did 9/11 Herald-Gazette” aren’t going to get quite as much bang for their advertising buck anymore, you’ll go back to getting your misinformation from your friends. What a horrible, horrible platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, none of this addresses the clickbait ads. While Facebook is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/business/media/publishers-rethink-outbrain-taboola-ads.html&quot;&gt;far from the only offender here&lt;/a&gt;, they’re the biggest and it’s especially ironic that even their &lt;em&gt;mea culpas&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.10zenmonkeys.com/2016/11/22/mark-zuckerberg-is-a-hypocrite/&quot;&gt;accompanied by bullshit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We take misinformation seriously,” Facebook’s CEO posted Saturday. Right next to two very obvious pieces of misinformation… Note the lying advertisers to the right of his status update? (No, Hugh Hefner [wasn’t] dead, and no, Tiger Woods hasn’t left the PGA forever.) Those ads don’t even lead to news stories. The first one leads to a site selling cures for erectile dysfunction, and the second leads to a site selling testosterone booster. But there’s something even worse about these two advertisers. Both of their web sites are designed to look like actual news sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is not up to the task, whether it’s Pages, the overall News Feed, or even its own ads. I can’t help but recall what &lt;a href=&quot;https://shift.newco.co/im-sorry-mr-zuckerberg-but-you-are-wrong-65dbf8513424&quot;&gt;Rick Webb wrote last year&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook about their business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In short, you’ve set foot into being a player in the news media, with zero interest in actually helping the news media, or in the social responsibilities that come with it. Now sure. You share ad revenue. But only popular stories garner ad revenue. You’ve aggravated the fundamental problem with internet news: only the most sensationalist stories generate the revenue. Whether the income came from subscriptions or ad revenue, in the old days, revenue to a paper was revenue to a paper. […] You could have helped fix this on the internet, but you didn’t. You made it worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What bothers me is not necessarily that Facebook failed, it’s that they so carelessly entered, destroyed, and departed the publisher market. They built something they can’t control to replace something they don’t understand, and they’re blowing it up once the market has adapted to accommodate it for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After the 2016 election, one of the ways I dealt with my anxiety was trying to grapple with the extent to which I lived in a news bubble.

Whether the income came from subscriptions or ad revenue, in the old days, revenue to a paper was revenue to a paper. […] You could have helped fix this on the internet, but you didn’t. You made it worse. What bothers me is not necessarily that Facebook failed, it’s that they so carelessly entered, destroyed, and departed the publisher market. They built something they can’t control to replace something they don’t understand, and they’re blowing it up once the market has adapted to accommodate it for better or worse.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">This Is Your Brain On Drugs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/post/this-your-brain-drugs/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="This Is Your Brain On Drugs" /><published>2018-01-17T15:34:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-17T15:34:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/post/this-your-brain-drugs</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/post/this-your-brain-drugs/">&lt;p&gt;Joshua Rothman for the New Yorker, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/are-we-all-awake-during-anesthesia&quot;&gt;reviews Kate Cole-Adams’s new book&lt;/a&gt; “Anesthesia: The Gift of Oblivion and the Mystery of Consciousness,” which—in addition to having a remarkably poetic subtitle—explores a variety of stories and studies on the weird stuff that happens when people go under general anesthesia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In her attempts to understand what going under anesthesia really entails, Cole-Adams encounters what Kate Leslie, an Australian anesthesiologist, calls “spooky little studies”—odd, suggestive, and often unreplicable experiments. In one such study, from 1993, Ian Russell, a British anesthesiologist, ties a tourniquet around the forearms of thirty-two women undergoing major gynecological surgery. He administers his anesthetic cocktail—the hypnotic drug midazolam, along with a painkiller and a muscle relaxant—then, by tightening the tourniquet, prevents the muscle relaxant from entering each woman’s hands and wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;During surgery, a recorded message plays through headphones in which Russell addresses each patient by name. “If you can hear me, I would like you to open and close the fingers of your right hand,” he says. If the woman moves her hand, Russell lifts one of the earpieces and asks her to squeeze his fingers; if she squeezes, he asks her to do it again if she is in pain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Of the thirty-two patients Russell tested, twenty-three squeezed to suggest they could hear, and twenty squeezed again to say they were in pain. Although Russell was supposed to test sixty patients, he was so unnerved by these results that he ended the trial early. It’s possible, he suggests, that the women were​ conscious and suffering on the operating table. If that’s the case, then general anesthesia might be better described as “general amnesia.” (Afterward, none of the women recalled hearing Russell’s voice or squeezing his hand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my very first date with my now-partner, I explained how terrified I was of general anesthesia because I’d heard a handful of stories not unlike this. It’s only right to make sure she knew what kind of neurotic ride she was boarding fairly early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I won’t be able to bring myself to read Cole-Adams’s book, this review definitely piques one’s curiosity; just how much do—and don’t— we understand about anesthesia? As one of the doctors interviewed by Cole-Adams explains: we don’t really understand consciousness, so how can we possibly understand what turns it off? If we don’t know how the sun rises, what makes us think we can make it set?

Just your typical story about a young parent with a home and a car and a job and the crushing psychological weight of knowing you’ll make loan payments until you die:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, when she finished her master’s degree, Sarah’s student loans totaled $60,000. She has paid steadily ever since and now owes $69,000 — more than twice the annual income she earns working as a children’s librarian.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“I keep paying,” the 31-year-old says. “But it’s like pouring into a bucket with no bottom.” […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The glimmer of hope Sarah clings to is her enrollment in a public service student loan forgiveness program that would clear her remaining debt if she puts in seven more years of work with the government and continues to make payments on time. But she’s heard horror stories of borrowers being disqualified from the program — which is available to people who work for the government or certain nonprofits after they have paid their loans on time for 10 years — because of a paperwork error. And she’s terrified the program will be quietly eliminated. (President Trump’s 2018 budget proposal did suggest cutting it for new borrowers but would still forgive debts of people currently enrolled.)&lt;/p&gt;

The title is actually a bit misleading, because there’s not so much outwitting the government as flouting the law and hoping the government doesn’t have enough resources to enforce the law. It’s been a good bet so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Since the robo-call ban went into effect in 2009, the FTC has brought just 33 cases against robo-callers. In those cases, defendants have been ordered to pay nearly $300 million in relief to victims, and nearly $30 million in civil penalties to the government. But even then, the FTC can’t force perpetrators to pay the fine if they argue they’re broke. Which robo-callers often seem to be. So the FTC has only collected on a fraction of those sums: $18 million in relief and less than $1 million in penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shell companies have insulated these folks from nearly 94% of the fines and damages they owe for breaking the law. Imagine if bank robbers could skirt the law like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In van Zuylen-Wood’s retelling, the government draws the ire of the public for failing to stop robo-calling spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the root of this public relations problem is a likely misapprehension about how the Do Not Call Registry works. When you add your number to the list, nothing actually happens. No legal muscle or technological wizardry suddenly prevents a solicitor from calling you. All the list does is provide you with vague recourse in the event you are called, by allowing you to complain that someone has called you. So, you can report the violation by calling a toll-free number or filling out a form on the Do Not Call website. Then, if the number you were called from shows up in enough complaints, the FTC will leap into action and prosecute the offending dialer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Except, it almost certainly won’t. In the age of live telemarketing, the mere threat of prosecution or penalty was enough to deter companies with shareholders and reputations to protect. In the robo-calling epoch, dialers couldn’t care less. One, nobody knows who they are or where they’re calling from, because they all spoof their numbers. Two, more of them are doing it every year, since it’s cheap and easy to blast out automated calls from anywhere in the world. All this makes it nearly impossible to identify robo-callers, let alone penalize them. At a hearing on robo-calls in October, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was getting so many of them, she’d disconnected her home phone. “The list,” she said, “doesn’t work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​The article also covers a series of variously effective technological band-aids for the underlying problem. Spoilers: none of them work, and we have to rely on the phone companies to fundamentally change how telephony works. Don’t hold your breath, only your calls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Simon van Zuylen-Wood’s latest in the Washington Post is on How robo-call moguls outwitted the government and completely wrecked the Do Not Call list.
