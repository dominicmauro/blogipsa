From Discover Magazine, a [12-year-old uses Dungeons and Dragons to help scientist dad with his research](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/10/30/12-year-old-uses-dungeons-and-dragons-to-help-scientist-dad-with-his-research/):

> Alan Kingstone, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia, had a problem: all humans have their eyes in the middle of their faces, and there’s nothing that Kingstone could do about it. His 12-year-old son, Julian Levy, had the solution: monsters. While some monsters are basically humanoid in shape, others have eyes on their hands, tails, tentacles and other unnatural body parts. Perfect. Kingstone would use monsters. And Julian would get his first publication in a journal from the Royal Society, one of the world’s most august scientific institutions.

I am a supporter in principle of any and all scientific research which cites to the [Monster's Manual](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/217207200).
