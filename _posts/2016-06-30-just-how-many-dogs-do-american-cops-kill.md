David Meyer Lindenberg, writing for Mimesis Law, on the rather [high number of dogs killed by American police every year]([http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/puppycide-just-how-many-dogs-do-american-cops-kill/10561]). The other surprising thing:

> The police penchant for shooting dogs gets totally inexplicable when you realize that not one cop has been killed by a dog in the past 80 years. According to the Officer Down Memorial Page, the last cop to die in this way was Officer Jackson Bennett of Gainesville, FL, who was bitten by a rabid street dog while on patrol and died April 27, 1936. Domesticated dogs havenâ€™t killed anyone in at least the last century.

A century! That can't be true, can it?
