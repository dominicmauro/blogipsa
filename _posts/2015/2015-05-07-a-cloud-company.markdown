Ben Thompson takes a look at how Amazon.com began, but quickly arrives at what [Amazon is doing today](https://stratechery.com/2015/the-aws-ipo/). Hint: it’s a $25 billion per year business (and growing) at Amazon alone.

> Today, public clouds are the future for the vast majority of businesses; the economics of scale achieved by Amazon (and its closest competitors, Google and Microsoft) are so incredible that multi-billion dollar companies like Netflix view it as more efficient to pay Amazon than to build their own data centers. The calculus is even more stark when it comes to any sort of startup: it’s so much easier and cheaper to get started with AWS that the idea of buying your own server infrastructure — an expense that consumed the majority of venture capital in the dot-com bubble era — is preposterous.
