A recent study tested how many people were willing to lie about flipping a coin, and to what extent they were willing to lie. Only somewhat surprisingly, bankers appear to have made a punchline out of themselves. William D. Cohan in [The Atlantic][1]:  

> The expected outcome is that half of each person’s tosses were heads and half were tails. And that pretty much was the result the researchers found when the bankers were not reminded, through a series of social cues, that they were bankers. They reported a winning toss 51.6 percent of the time, an outcome that is statistically indistinguishable from the 50 percent expectation.

I'm told by my funnier friends that this is what's referred to as "the setup" in comedy.

> The result changed dramatically, alas, when the bankers were encouraged to remember their profession – a psychological phenomenon referred to as “identity priming.” When so prompted, they reported a winning result 58.2 percent of the time. It was very likely, the researchers found, that more than a quarter of the bankers had cheated. 

These folks were flipping a coin ten times, and they were paid $20 for each "correct" result (randomly selected as heads or tails for each person). I would venture that employees of the kinds of financial institutions in question make a lot more than $20 an hour. 

> Worse, they discovered, this increased predilection to cheat was unique to banking. When nonbanker coin flippers were reminded of how they spent their time as professionals or as students, they showed no change in their tendency to cheat. “Our results thus suggest that the prevailing business culture in the banking industry weakens and undermines the honesty norm,” the researchers concluded. Or, more simply, as Alain Cohn, a lead author of the study, told me recently, “the apples are good, but the barrel is bad.”

Fascinating.
