Lots of people apparently think the government is looking out for their interests online. These are some impressive numbers:

> 49% of American adults who use the Internet believe (incorrectly) that by law a supermarket must obtain a person’s permission before selling information about that person’s food purchases to other companies.
>
> 69% do not know that a pharmacy does not legally need a person’s permission to sell information about the over-the-counter drugs that person buys.
>
> 65% do not know that the statement “When a website has a privacy policy, it means the site will not share my information with other websites and companies without my permission” is false.
>
> 55% do not know it is legal for an online store to charge different people different prices at the same time of day.
>
> 62% do not know that price-comparison sites like Expedia or Orbitz are not legally required to include the lowest travel prices.”
