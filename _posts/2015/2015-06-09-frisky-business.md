Another day, another bleeding heart hippie in New York City pretending that Stopping and Frisking youths doesn't prevent crime. Get real, man! It's scientific fact. It's us versus them, and cops need to be forced to stop and frisk hundreds of thousands of kids a year or we'll slip into an age of lawlessness the likes of which you can't imagine. 

Let's hear what the [hippie of the week][1] has to say:

> “Let's get over this issue of stop-question-and-frisk, how impactful it is, or isn’t,” Bratton said in a press conference at NYPD headquarters this morning. He pointed to 2011 as proof. That year, the city recorded 685,000 stop-and-frisks, the most ever. And, Bratton said, “In that year, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, grand larcenies were all up—the year that we did the most stop-questions-and-frisks.”

> Last year, Bratton said, police officers conducted approximately 48,000 stops, and “murders, rapes, robberies, assaults, burglaries, grand larcenies, were all down. So, the year we had the highest number of stop-question-and-frisks, which so many are clamoring to go back to, we actually had more crime and less of a reduction. Last year, when we had the lowest number of stop-question-and-frisks, we had much less crime.”

All right, this Bratton guy clearly has his head in the clouds. Who is he? Where does he get off making up nonsense like this? Why, I ought to-

> New York Police Department commissioner Bill Bratton, responding to a call from some police union leaders to conduct more stop-and-frisks amid an uptick in violent incidents…

Oh. Well, then. 

Seriously, though, Stop and Frisk is unrelated to the amount of crime in New York City, and it's refreshing and A Good Thing that the police commissioner says things like this. What's more interesting to me is police union leaders calling for more Stops and Frisks to combat crime. (Which they pretend is rising, but is [still falling][2] at roughly the same rate it has been for decades) I'm not sure how public and contentious that disagreement is going to get.
