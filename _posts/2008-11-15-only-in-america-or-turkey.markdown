This one comes from the "less than ideal litigation" department. The [city of Batman](http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117995653.html?categoryid=13&cs=1), Turkey, is suing the movie studio responsible for the Batman movies. If you're anything like me, your first reaction was likely "there's a city named Batman?" And apparently there is, in the Kurdish section of Turkey. Your second reaction is "holy smokes, Batman! Whatever for?" if you're a gigantic dork.

The lawsuit claims that using the town's name without permission has led to psychological trauma for the town's citizens, which has caused a high female suicide rate, as well as a number of unsolved murders. I'm interested to see how this works out. (Mostly because I've never actually seen a judge fall off her bench from laughing so hard.)

So the next time you're feeling down, just think to yourself that it could be worse: you could be Batman.
