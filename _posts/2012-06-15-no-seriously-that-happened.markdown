Giancarlo Esposito, who plays Gus on one of my favorite TV shows Breaking Bad, was in beautiful New York City recently, and had a [run-in with the police](http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/breaking-bads-giancarlo-esposito-and-healing-power-gus-fring-44131?page=0,1). They were apparently not fans of his work:

> Days before the interview, Esposito was stopped and frisked by New York police while walking out of a theater where he was rehearsing a play. After several frantic minutes – with him and officers screaming, and their guns drawn – they realized they had the wrong guy. Their suspect had a hoodie, and Esposito was wearing a suit. When it was over, one of the officers recognized him, from his recent turn on ABC's "Once Upon a Time."

You know, Breaking Bad would be over after like the second episode if it took place in Manhattan instead of Albuquerque. Oh, and if Walter White were black, apparently. (Kidding! [Kind of](http://www.nyclu.org/stopandfrisk).)
