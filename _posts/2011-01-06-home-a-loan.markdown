[Barry Ritholtz comments on a Massachusetts Supreme court case](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/01/can-banks-foreclose-on-mortgages-they-do-not-own/), where several homeowners have sued to void their foreclosures "because securitization-industry practices violate real-estate law governing how mortgages may be transferred."  He says:

> here are several issues in the case: The technical one is whether a mortgage can be transferred without naming the recipient, as is commonly done in securitizations. But the more important issue applies to mortgage rights — do they “detach” from the promissory note when that note is sold? Asked more plainly, _must someone asserting the right to foreclose actually own that Note_?
>
> This is more than a technical issue; at risk is whether we, as a nation, are going to allow corporate entities to violate existing law, or even worse, attempt to create their own, extra-legal, non democratic policies.

I usually find sweeping statements like that more irritating than inspiring, but Ritholtz is too educated to ignore. And the consequences are pretty straightforward: Wells Fargo foreclosed on Mr. and Mrs. Larace's house 10 months before the bank owned the mortgage. There are more sketchy details in [the original Bloomberg story](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/foreclosures-may-be-undone-by-massachusetts-ruling-on-mortgage-transfers.html), but this case is pretty binary, like Ritholtz says; either banks get to break the law and take your stuff, or they don't.
