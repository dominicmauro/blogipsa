Google has recently [struck a deal](http://www.scribd.com/doc/35599242/Verizon-Google-Legislative-Framework-Proposal) with Verizon: I think they're both hedging their bets in case this whole "Net Neutrality" thing doesn't pan out. Google managed to wring out of Verizon a promise to leave the "regular" internet open, but the mobile internet (which is [increasingly becoming](http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/resources/news-briefs/6991.html) "the internet") is apparently fair game for all manner of tiered services. Reaction to this agreement has been varied; Epicenter has a nice roundup of the varied op-eds from around the blagonet.
