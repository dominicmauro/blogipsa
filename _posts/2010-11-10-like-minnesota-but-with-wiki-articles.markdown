A quick congratulations to [The IT Law Wiki](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/The_IT_Law_Wiki) on reaching 10,000 articles. I really like this project, and I think they're as ambitious as they are overlooked by the web at large. In their own words:

> The IT Law Wiki is a web-based, free content encyclopedia project. Its goal is to catalog all of the legal issues, cases, statutes, events, people, organizations and publications that make up the global field of [information technology law](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Information_technology_law) (often referred to as [computer law](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Computer_law)). 
>
> The IT Law Wiki is written collaboratively by volunteers from around the world. With rare exceptions, its articles can be [edited](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Editing) by anyone with access to the [Internet](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Internet), simply by [clicking](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Click) the edit this page link.
>
> The IT Law Wiki is continually updated, with the creation or updating of articles on topical events possible within seconds, minutes or hours, rather than months or years for traditional printed publications. This way, the[information](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Information) here can be as up-to-date as possible, instead of having to wait for a small group of people to update the [information](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Information) as the world changes. The more people that use the IT Law Wiki, the more up-to-date the[information](http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/Information) will be.
