From Engadget, [RSA hacked, data exposed that could 'reduce the effectiveness' of SecurID tokens](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/18/rsa-hacked-data-exposed-that-could-reduce-the-effectiveness-o/):

> RSA, the security division of EMC and producer of the SecurID systems used by countless corporations (and the Department of Defense), has been hacked. Yesterday it sent out messages to its clients and posted an open letter stating that it's been the victim of an "advanced" attack that "resulted in certain information being extracted from RSA's systems" – information "specifically related to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products."

I look forward to reading about how this happened. Ars Technica's [magnificent writeup of the HBGary](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/the-ridiculous-plan-to-attack-wikileaks.ars) attacks was impossible to put down.
