Continuing on the SOPA thing, Wil Wheaton makes fun of the MPAA like I did. But he does it better.

>  When you complain that opponents didn’t “come to the table to find solutions”, do you mean that we didn’t give *NINETY-FOUR MILLION DOLLARS* to congress like the MPAA? Or do you mean that we didn’t come to the one hearing that Lamar Smith held, where opponents of SOPA were refused an opportunity to comment? Help me out, here, Chris Dodd, because I’m really trying hard to understand you.

Read the rest of the vaguely-titled post [Today the US Senate is considering legislation that would destroy the free and open Internet](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2012/01/today-the-us-senate-is-considering-legislation-that-would-destroy-the-free-and-open-internet.html), and have a good laugh. Or cry. Laughcrying is the best medicine.
