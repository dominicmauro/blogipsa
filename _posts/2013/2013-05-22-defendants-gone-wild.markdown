The guy who made those really sleazy "Girls Gone Wild" videos, which at one point seemed to comprise half the ads on Comedy Central after midnight, has an interesting closing statement for his assault and false imprisonment trial:

> I want that jury to know that each and every one of you are mentally f–ing retarded and you should be euthanized […] if that jury wants to convict me because I didn’t show up, which is the only reason why they did, then, you know, they should all be lined up and shot.

Actually, he was already found guilty, and he made [these remarks (and more!)](http://www.salon.com/2013/05/22/girls_gone_wild_creator_joe_francis_to_jury_you_should_be_euthanized/) to a reporter in an interview before his sentencing. I'm reminded of that hacker who did an AMA on Reddit the night before his sentencing, wherein he declaimed his lack of remorse and general lesson-learning that I think judges probably like hearing. [Prosecutors and judge noticed](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4118484/andrew-weev-auernheimer-sentenced-att-ipad-hack). Maybe the jury will notice this one.
