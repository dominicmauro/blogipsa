So there was already that one juror from the George Zimmerman trial who had [never heard of manslaughter](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/post/tip-of-my-tongue/), despite being on the jury in a case where she feels the guy holding the gun exercised poor judgment which ended in someone else dying. There was that one.

Another juror from that case, who didn't want to be identified, [appeared on ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-juror-murder/story?id=19770659) (giving her first name, age, occupation, how many children she has, her home town, and her current town; as one does when one does not wish to be identified) and this happened:

> George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can’t get away from God.

and then:

> When asked by Roberts whether the case should have gone to trial, Maddy said, “I don’t think so.”

If this is who got on the jury, who get kicked off by [voir dire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire)?
