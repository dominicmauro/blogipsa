Last week, The Atlantic ran an ad from noted Anti-Xenu enthusiasts Scientology, before being ridiculed for taking money from crazy people, and ultimately [pulling the ad](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/200593/the-atlantic-pulls-sponsored-content-from-church-of-scientology/) from their site. I guess some of the uproar was about taking money from people who've been accused of running a cult, or possibly some perceived ambiguity of the term "sponsored post" (what do you mean 'a word from our sponsors' NBC? do you believe the Dodge Dart is the #1 car in America or not help i'm so confused). Whatever. Post went up, post went down, and The Atlantic issued an apology. 

But not before noted internet institution Boing Boing took the [opportunity to lampoon](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/14/dread-cthulhu-leads-his-cult-t.html) either the outcry, the original ad, or Scientology itself. I'm not sure:

> The driving force behind this unparalleled era of growth is Cthulhu himself, who is not only a cosmic entity of inordinate and terrible power, but also chairman of the board of the Esoteric Order of Dagon. Mr. Cthulhu is unrelenting in His work, providing charitable assistance to worthwhile causes, serving communities with fresh humanitarian initiatives, and afflicting all mankind with a transcendent anxiety though His eldritch murmurs.

Never to be outdone, America's Finest News Source Comma The Onion ran [an even sillier sponsored post](http://www.theonion.com/articles/sponsored-the-taliban-is-a-vibrant-and-thriving-po,30910/?ref=auto): 

> 2012 proved to be just another in a succession of landmark years for the Taliban, as the influential Islamic fundamentalist organization continued its awe-inspiring push toward unprecedented expansion.
>
> Even following a decade marked with some difficulties, the devoted members of the Afghani cultural and political movement have proven consistently successful in their trailblazing efforts to continue the Talibanâ€™s constant recruiting of talented and diverse young insurgents and building its thriving base of support from politicians and citizens alike to over 30 times that of a decade ago.

Scientology might be a parody of itself, but I'm quite thankful for the actual parodies.
