Bitcoin, that digital currency only several orders of magnitude less useful than Xbox Live Points, has been the subject of some really fun news pieces recently. There was the e-sports league surreptitiously [running a mining operation with its users' computers](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/esea/). There was the exchange which shut its doors and [ran off with $260,000+](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/weeks-after-shutdown-bitcoin-exchange-customers-still-wait-for-refunds/) of its customers' "money". A speculative bubble around Bitcoin popped last month, [collapsing nearly $200 in under a week](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/04/12/as-key-exchange-mtgox-reopens-bitcoin-falls-to-74-some-72-down-from-its-former-heights/). At least you know Bitcoin is always worth a funny story.

So the largest Bitcoin exchange (that thing which converts Bitcoins into money) is a Magic: The Gathering card trading site (yes, [really](http://web.archive.org/web/20070817170606/http://mtgox.com/gwt/mtgox.php)) called Mt. Gox, which has trafficked in Bitcoin for the last few years. They just had (one of?) their bank account(s?) seized by Homeland Security. [Ars has a good writeup](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/feds-reveal-the-search-warrant-that-seized-mt-gox-account/) of why this has happened, including detailed quotes from the key portion of [the warrant](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Mt-Gox-Dwolla-Warrant-5-14-13.pdf).

**tl;dr: Mt. Gox forgot to register as a currency exchange, which is a federal felony.**

As part of the [Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5330), all Money Transmitting Businesses must register with the Department of the Treasury. Neither Mt. Gox nor its US subsidiary Mutum Sigullum, LLC. are registered as such. Whoops. The [Bitcoin subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ee0bc/feds_reveal_the_search_warrant_used_to_seize_mt/) is directing their displeasure toward Mt. Gox, whose navigation of regulatory matters is admittedly pretty displeasure-worthy. It's okay, guys! An efficient market would never allow such egregious incompetence to handle two-thirds of all Bitcoin exchanges. ([Yes, Virginia](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/volumepie/), etc.)

So wait, the coming crypto-currency wars? The stateless society? Post-capitalism anarcho-digital-libertarian utopia? All sidetracked because someone didn't do their homework? What, don't any lawyers take bitcoins? Hm. 

How about Magic cards?
