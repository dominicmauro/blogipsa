People are usually pretty surprised to find out that I don't know a lot of technologically savvy attorneys. In fact, I think most attorneys regard technology the way they regard math — alternately bewildered and indifferent. The following conversation had me cracking up at my desk today:

> A: Intern brought in his own computer. It's a 15" MBP, unibody. It has fucking 10.5.8 He can't even run Chrome. Get the @#%$# out.
>
> B: How a person's own gear is set up is a pretty reliable indicator for technical competence, imo.
>
> A: Not doing anything technical for us, just content writing until he goes to law school in the fall…
