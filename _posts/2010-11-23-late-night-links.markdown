This is a new feature of Barely Legally, one that involves much less writing, and many more snarky one-liners. If this lawyer thing doesn't work out, I'll just be a writer for that fortune-cookie company down the block.

On to the links!

* Google Street View shows naked man climbing out of the trunk of a car. This happened in Germany, because hey, why not? [[Technically Incorrect](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20023487-71.html)]
* Microsoft's new version of Internet Explorer is really, really good at this one benchmark. Are they cheating, or just using the programmer's version of a warp whistle? [[T3ch H3lp](http://t3chh3lp.com/blog/was-internet-explorer-9-cheating-the-benchmarks-roundup.html)]
* Man, this "predictive text" stuff on phones these days is getting really smart. It must have found all your Google searches for divorce attorneys. [[DamnYouAutocorrect](http://damnyouautocorrect.com/1120/the-big-d/)]
* Area 51 is a "place" you can review on Google Maps. The internet ensues. [[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14237879067141035522&q=area+51&view=feature&mcsrc=google_reviews&num=10&start=0&ved=0CCcQtQU&sa=X&ei=AQzrTM_DA4SazASy5rHCDg)]
* Microsoft is not pleased to find out that you nerds want to hack the Kinect. They promise to "work closely with law enforcement" to halt tampering. [[CNET News](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-20021836-52.html)]
* Microsoft is actually very excited to see what you nerds have done with your Kinect hacking. [[Mashable](http://mashable.com/2010/11/20/microsoft-kinect-hacks/)]
* Microsoft totally left the Kinect open by design, guys. They were, like, _sooo_ joking with that whole "law enforcement" bit before. You kids have fun, now. [[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/11/microsoft-claims-kinect-left-open-by-design-with-bonus-hacked-vids.ars)]
* Computer Engineer Barbie is now on sale. Your move, Malibu Stacy. [[Nerd Approved](http://nerdapproved.com/approved-products/you-can-now-buy-a-nerd-girl-barbie-i-totally-approve/)]
