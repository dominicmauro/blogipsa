The RIAA is suing the makers of the file-sharing software LimeWire for $75 trillion. The judge is not amused:

> “If Plaintiffs were able to pursue a statutory damage theory predicated on the number of direct infringers per work, defendants’ damages could reach into the trillions. [...]
>
> As Defendants note, **Plaintiffs are suggesting an award that is ‘more money than the entire music recording industry has made since Edison’s invention of the phonograph in 1877’**. The absurdity of this result is one of the factors that has motivated other courts to reject Plaintiffs’ damages theory.”
