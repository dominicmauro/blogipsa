From megafirm [Weil, Gotshal & Manges](http://www.weil.com/) comes the [Weil Bankruptcy Blog’s Sweet Sixteen](http://business-finance-restructuring.weil.com/survey/march-madness-the-weil-bankruptcy-blog’s-sweet-sixteen/)! The Business Finance & Restructuring Team has their own blog, and apparently someone has been carving tally marks into the stone walls of the document review gulags! That can only mean one thing:

> In the spirit of March Madness, we’ve asked the attorneys in Weil’s Business Finance & Restructuring department to compile a list of the most influential, transformative, or game-changing U.S. bankruptcy decisions of all time – a “Sweet Sixteen of Bankruptcy.” 
>
> In the coming weeks, we’ll be asking you to decide the winners of each matchup and crown the ultimate champion of our Big Dance of Bankruptcy.

Oh, man. I've got Unsecured Creditors Commission v. Noyes (In re STN Enterprises, Inc.) to win the whole thing! I'm a sucker for a good Cinderella story!
