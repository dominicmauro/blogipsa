Will the economy fall apart? Will it grind to a halt? Slow to a crawl? I have absolutely no idea. But I do know that I'm really glad I didn't go into finance. As for people that did? The New York Times has a nice article called "[Finance Students Keep Their Job Hopes Alive.](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/education/12student.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin)" Hey, good luck guys. But what's this?

> Mr. Murray described the mood at Princeton as cautiously optimistic. “No one I’ve talked to is worried about moving back home yet,” he said. “But **everyone I know is studying for the LSATs right now, people who a month ago had no intention of ever going to law school**.”

Boy, am I glad I didn't put this law school thing off. I get a nice little head start on the folks who are abandoning the financial sector and moving into the legal field.
