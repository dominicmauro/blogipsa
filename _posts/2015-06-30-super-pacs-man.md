Remember that time Stephen Colbert ran a years-long piece of performance art about the ridiculous election laws in America? He called it the [Colbert Super PAC][1], it was eye-opening. Colbert's show won a Peabody for excellence in journalism for that. On Comedy Central! 

But one presidential candidate is out to prove the election laws are an [even bigger joke][2] than that:

> Back in April, the executive director of the super PAC backing Carly Fiorina dared the Federal Election Commission to sanction the organization for calling itself “Carly for America,” which violated rules prohibiting using a candidate’s name in the name of a legally unaffiliated PAC.
>
> “It could be Carly for Puppies, it could be Carly for Freedom,” Mr. DeMaura said then. “There’s no legal prohibition against the type of name that we use. I think the reason that many don’t do it is for practical political reasons not based in legal fact.”

The fact that the guy running a super PAC – ostensibly barred from coordinating with the candidate – didn't know he couldn't use the candidate's name? Kinda funny. The comeuppance is a little funnier:

> It took the FEC less than three weeks to send a formal letter of reprimand to Carly for America.
>
> So after some deliberation, on Monday the Fiorina super PAC changed its name. It’s no longer Carly for America. It’s now Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You and for America – though it will be known by the acronym CARLY for America.

The legal term for this is a "giant middle finger" to FEC.
