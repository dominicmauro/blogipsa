I'll figure out the title later. For now, all you need to know is at [Ars](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/judge-scolds-righthaven-lawyer-adds-another-32000-judgment.ars):

> Copyright troll Righthaven has once again been hit with another big bill. The case, Righthaven v. Leland Wolf, targeted the It Makes Sense Blog for allegedly posting a photograph that appeared in Righthaven client the Denver PostÂ without its permission. The court has found in favor of the defendant and has ordered Righthaven to pony up $32,147 in attorney's fees and $1,000 in costs.

It turns out that running around filing frivolous copyright infringement lawsuits on the internet isn't a good idea. Funny thing about that internet thing: people can figure out their rights pretty quickly.
