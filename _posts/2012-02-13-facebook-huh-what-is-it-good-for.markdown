[An open letter to Facebook](http://www.jakelevine.me/blog/2012/02/facebook-its-like-instagram-for-birthdays/). This fellow does a good job honing in on the actual usefulness of Facebook:

> For you, my network can only grow in one direction: bigger. We don’t meet fewer people as we get older. We meet more people! And if we know more people, our “Friends” list should grow accordingly. We don’t forget people do we? If we’ve met them, they belong in our Facebook network.
>
> You seem to think that Facebook is the only network I’ll ever need; that instead of adding and removing people as your features and my real world networks evolve, I should just move them into smaller groups and manage a massive number of impossible-to-understand privacy settings. Because for you, my identity and how I interact with the people that make up my life are as straightforward and comprehendible as the blue in my profile.
