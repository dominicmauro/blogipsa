[Cindy Cohn,](http://www.eff.org/about/staff/cindy-cohn) the legal director at the EFF, has written a wonderful [review of the Google-Verizon deal](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/08/google-verizon-netneutrality) that seems to have the entire internet aflutter. If you've never heard of the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/about), rest assured that they've worked tirelessly to advance civil liberties on the internet before any of us had even heard of the internet.

I had the good fortune to meet Ms. Cohn this past Spring; she's remarkably brilliant, and you'll be hard-pressed to find a more cogent analysis of the Google-Verizon deal from a net-neutrality perspective than the EFF's take.
