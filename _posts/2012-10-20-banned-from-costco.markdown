> When last year’s hard drive shortage threatened Backblaze’s all-you-can-store cloud backup service, the company had to get creative to keep up its 50TB-a-day hard drive habit. The solution: external hard drives from retail stores and an army of volunteers making sure they kept coming.

[GigaOM on Backblaze](http://gigaom.com/cloud/how-to-add-5-5-petabytes-and-get-banned-from-costco-during-a-hard-drive-crisis/)'s creative measures to keep the company going. I actually use them for backing up my stuff online. They had a [fun little blog post](http://blog.backblaze.com/2012/10/09/backblaze_drive_farming/) about the problems they saw during the hard drive shortage following the [2011 Thailand floods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Thailand_floods#Damages_to_industrial_estates_and_global_supply_shortages), and GigaOM follows up with an interesting story about how you keep "unlimited storage" from being "unlimited* storage."
