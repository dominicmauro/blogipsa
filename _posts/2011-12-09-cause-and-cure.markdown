Writing 2200 words on defamation and tech policy things was draining; how about a soft news story for the weekend? A little Friday afternoon feel-good story? Okay, here goes.

An athlete who has been paraplegic for half her life suddenly regained the use of her legs after injuring her spinal cord in a bike accident. From [NBC Sports](http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/45597247/ns/sports-other_sports/):

> Paralympic silver medalist Monique van der Vorst has miraculously become an able-bodied Olympic hopeful after a crash reversed her paralysis. Paralyzed from the hip down since she was 13, the 27-year-old handcyclist, who has just signed with the Rabobank women's professional cycling team to compete as a top-class able-bodied athlete, was hit by a bicycle last year while training in her wheelchair for the 2012 London Paralympics.
>
> While recovering from the trauma, van der Vorst's feet started to tingle and miraculously she began to move them again. From that point on she spent months in the hospital and in the rehabilitation centre trying to regain the use of her legs.

Spinal trauma: the cause of, and solution to, paralysis. Take that, medical science!
