If you're as obsessed with the true-crime podcast Serial as everyone else is, this Vox [interview with Colin Miller](http://www.vox.com/2014/12/10/7363799/serial-adnan-syed-appeal) may be right up your alley. Miller is a law professor who has taken to [writing about](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2014/12/ive-done-fourteen-posts-hereherehereherehereherehereherehereherehereherehere-andhere-about-sarah-koenigsseri.html) legal issues that come up in the podcast.

> Vox: How difficult is it to prove ineffective assistance of counsel? My impression is that it's very hard â€” there are people whose lawyers fell asleep during the trial, and they didn't win on that appeal.
>
> Miller: If you are looking at it empirically, there are a number of studies that look at what actually happens [in ineffective assistance of counsel cases]. That claim is successful between 1 and 8 percent of the time.
>
> In terms of the legal standards, Strickland v. Washington [a 1984 court case about when ineffective assistance of counsel violated the Sixth Amendment] set up a two-pronged test. The first prong asks: was there an error or errors by defense counsel that caused the performance to fall below a prevailing standard of reasonableness?

The first season of [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org) is wrapping up later this week, but the fun doesn't have to stop there. Miller is up to [sixteen posts](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2014/12/ive-done-fourteen-posts-hereherehereherehereherehereherehereherehereherehere-andhere-about-sarah-koenigsseri.html) about the legal issues involved. We can law nerd all over this, guys! I'll get the highlighters and you get the index cards.
