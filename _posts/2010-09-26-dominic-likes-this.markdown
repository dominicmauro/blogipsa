In my third year of law school, I helped launch a legal reporting blog at my school; [Legal As She Is Spoke](http://lasisblog.com) gives students a chance to practice writing (and thinking) about the law.  The stories principally correct the mangled or absent legal analysis in the news.  I do a bit of that here, but I think these folks do a better job than I do most of the time.

My new favorite is "Judge Throws (Face)Book at Juror" — we all know it's a bad thing for a juror to be eager to convict someone before the end of the trial.  But why exactly is it such a bad thing?  The answers can be surprising sometimes.

> During a trial in Massachusetts, a juror fired off an e-mail to 800 of his closest friends saying, “[j]ust say he’s guilty and lets [sic] get on with our lives!” The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court [rejected](http://www.suffolk.edu/sjc/archive/2007/SJC_09093.html) the defendant’s claim that he was prejudiced by the juror misconduct. 
>
> The court reasoned that the jurors were not exposed to any extraneous information that would have compromised the fairness of the trial. Similarly, Ms. Jons’s Facebook post is not a search for information related to the case, but a communication with her friends about the case.
