My old law professor has a new blog post [analyzing possible legal consequences](http://laboratorium.net/archive/2011/06/06/worldwide_developer_copyright) for some of the shiny new features Apple announced last week. My favorite:

> [iTunes Match](http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/) is great, I’m really happy for you, Imma let you finish, but think for a moment about the privacy implications of asking Apple to scan your entire music library and report back on it to the Apple mothership.
 
> Right now, Genius scans your collection and reports back, but all that information is “stored anonymously.” Anonymity doesn’t work if the point is to push out actual music files to all of your devices. Similarly, this goes beyond other cloud services in that you’re not uploading specific chosen files; iTunes Match is designed to scan your entire music collection, no matter how gigantic.
