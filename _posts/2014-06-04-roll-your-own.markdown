Google is testing a plugin for Gmail that enables end-to-end encryption of emails. If widely adopted, this would make it impossible for Google to data mine the content of your emails to sell targeted ads. I predict this doesn't catch on.

You could also predict this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/digiphile">@digiphile</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/google">@google</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/timbray">@timbray</a> How might one check that their Chrome extension isn&#39;t backdoored (due to an NSL)? You still have to trust Google</p>&mdash; brianbehlendorf (@brianbehlendorf) <a href="https://twitter.com/brianbehlendorf/statuses/473955392678944769">June 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

Never trust software anyone else makes. Wash behind your ears. Code your own security tools. Actually, if I could stop being smarmy for half a second, this guy is on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who actually did [code their own](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop) system. So, you know, nicely done.

But wait guys how do we know EFF hasn't received a National Security Let-*gunshot*
