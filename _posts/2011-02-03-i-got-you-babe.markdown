I love the movie Groundhog Day — it popped up in several of my philosophy classes in college, and again in law school. The Library of Congress has a copy archived, because the movie is a significant cultural work. Phil spends years trapped in a time loop, but the movie never specifies how many. I just read the most definitive deconstruction of it:

> The first stage is to work out how many separate days are shown on screen during the movie. So here’s a good old-fashioned list of them:
>
>   * Day 1: Groundhog Day
>   * Day 2: The first repetition
>   * Day 3: The fixed pencil
>   * Day 4: Punching Ned
>   * Day 5: Deceiving Nancy
>   * Day 6: Robbing the bank
>   * Day 7: Seeing Heidi 2 with a French Maid
>   * Days 8-12: Engineering the near-perfect date
>   * Day 13: The bad perfect date
>   * Days 14-21: One for every slap
>   * Day 22: “Phil you look terrible!”
>   * Day 23: Jeopardy
>   * Day 24: “This is pitiful!”
>   * Days 25-27: Breaking the alarm clock
>   * Day 28: Kidnapping Punxsutawney Phil
>   * Day 29-31: Phil’s suicides
>   * Day 32: I’m a God!
>   * Days 33- 35: First piano lessons
>   * Day 36: Sexually harassing Ned
>   * Day 37: Looking after the homeless man	
>   * Day 38: The final Groundhog Day
