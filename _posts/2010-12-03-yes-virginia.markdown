When I check my readership statistics, I like to see what search terms people are using to find my site. One day last month, these were the only three visitors who were referred from a search engine:

![](/images/yes-virginia.png)

Yes, the deadly martial art of jujitsu, also known as "[wearing pajamas and letting another man lie on top of you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x5zTRLcUkM)" is legal in New York.

I have no idea how far down the Google search results you'd have to scroll to find "BarelyLegally.com" from "Berly Leagly."

As for the "Almost Legal" guy: something tells me he was a little disappointed when he got here. That's leftover from the old blog name of Almost Legally. Good thing I changed the name to something much less easily confused for porn, right?
