The [future is weird](http://www.theawl.com/2015/01/why-you-should-always-lock-your-car-doors-in-san-francisco), guys. But not in the "robots will rise up and try to kill people" way.

> At some point every car in San Francisco will be an Uber and every citizen, a driver, so I shouldn’t have been surprised when a random stranger walked up to my car, opened the passenger door, and started to take a seat. Actually, it’s really my fault. I pulled over to respond to a text from my wife a few yards from the famous-for-charging-too-much-for-toast coffee shop, The Mill. If you’re a car near The Mill, you’re probably picking up or dropping off a very important startup founder or VC.

> Still it was a bit surprising when a gentleman who was on the phone started to get into my car. Before he actually took a seat, he peered into the vehicle and I asked, “Can I help you?” His response, “Oh shit!” He then quickly closed the door and ran off. I mean ran in the literal sense. He actually ran away from the car. 

It used to be that in order to kidnap anyone, you needed a Lincoln towncar and a markerboard. Uber has disrupted that market.
