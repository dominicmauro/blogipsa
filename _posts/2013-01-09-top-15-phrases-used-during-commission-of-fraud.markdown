How can you tell if one of your employees has committed fraud, and is currently considering covering up their misdeeds? According to [a new study](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240175638/Ernst-Young-email-keyword-analysis-identifies-ID-fraudsters) published by accounting firm Ernst & Young, apparently you can start by searching for the phrase "cover up." No, really. Here are the top 15 phrases:

1. Cover up
2. Write off
3. Illegal
4. Failed investment
5. Nobody will find out
6. Grey area
7. They owe it to me
8. Do not volunteer information
9. Not ethical
10. Off the books
11. Backdate
12. No inspection
13. Pull earnings forward
14. Special fees
15. Friendly payments

I thought this was fake until I saw Ernst & Young's name pop up *eleven* times on Wikipedia's [article about accounting scandals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_scandals). They must be experts at this kind of thing.  Via [Quartz](http://qz.com/41048/nobody-will-find-out-and-other-phrases-commonly-used-in-emails-by-fraudsters/).
