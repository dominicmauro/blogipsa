Today, Barely Legally has a new look: a theme I designed called **Redacre**. While I've tinkered with and updated the design of the site pretty much constantly since launch day, this is the first major overhaul in this history of the site. If you spot any bugs, please [drop me a line](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/contact).

Also, I used some [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) code in the creation of Redacre, so the theme has been published under the GPL 2 license, and its source code is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/dominicmauro). For the download link and more information about the theme, see the [Code](#) page, where I publish all my nerdings-on about town.

**Update** I'm doing [Octopress](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/post/easy-tips-octopress) now.
