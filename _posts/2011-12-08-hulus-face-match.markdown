From [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/8/2620375/hulu-face-match-beta):

> Hulu today announced Face Match, a new feature that allows viewers to hover their cursor over an actor's face in a video to find out their name and other background information.

What. Whaaaat. *mind blown* When Facebook does it, it's a little creepy. But when Hulu does it, it's the greatest thing I've ever seen.
