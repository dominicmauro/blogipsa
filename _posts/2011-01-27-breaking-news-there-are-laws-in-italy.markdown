I love how in Italy, if you're accused of having sex with a couple of seventeen year old prostitutes, your two best defenses appear to be (1) yes, I had sex with those minors, but I didn't pay for it; and (2) yes, I paid for sex with those women, but only after they were adults.

Mr. Berlusconi has now been accused of sexual relations with a second teenaged prostitute:

> The girl, named as Iris Berardi, was known to police as a prostitute, Italian reports say, and attended one of the events days before turning 18.
>
> [...]
>
> [The age of consent in Italy is 14.] Â Using the services of prostitutes is not a crime in Italy, but paying a prostitute aged under 18 is an offence.
