A couple months back, I ran a conference about the future of legal education. The legal industry is undergoing a massive restructuring; entry-level legal jobs are being automated in ever greater numbers. As it turns out, paying someone $160,000 a year to search through documents is slightly absurd these days. Computers do all that work, and you don't need to pay them, because all they eat is [old peoples' medicine](http://www.hulu.com/watch/2340/saturday-night-live-old-glory).

One guy is streets ahead on this whole thing, and has formed a law firm with our future overlords. The coolest law firm ever:Â [Robot, Robot & Hwang](http://www.robotandhwang.com/).
