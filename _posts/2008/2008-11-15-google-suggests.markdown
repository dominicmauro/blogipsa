[![who really cares about law school anyway](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/assets/images/2008/11/bankrupt1.jpg)

I'm not really sure what to make of this. There are 17 million results for "should I go to law school?" and only 1 million for "should I go bankrupt?" "Should I go blonde" has more results than those two trifling issues **combined**.

I do like that "should I go out with him" has as many results as "should I go to (1) law school (2) medical school and (3) grad school" combined.

(Yes, you should go to law school. You will gain magical lawyer powers.)
