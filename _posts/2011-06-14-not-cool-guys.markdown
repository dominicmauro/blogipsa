From Ars Technica: [Bloomberg says Comcast is already violating conditions of NBCU merger](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/06/bloomberg-comcast-is-already-violating-conditions-of-nbcu-merger.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss):

> In Washington DC for example, Comcast carries CNN, Fox News, MSNBC and CNBC on channels 35-39. Bloomberg TV, by contrast, is way down the dial ot channel 103, next to C-Span 2 and C-Span 3.

> […]
>
> When it approved the merger, the FCC noted that “by foreclosing or disadvantaging rival programming networks, Comcast can increase subscribership or advertising revenue for its own programming content.”

I am shocked. Shocked, I say! Who could have foreseen this?
