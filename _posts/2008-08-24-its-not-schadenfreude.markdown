Apparently, one of the law schools that rejected me was just named the "Ugliest Campus in America" by some magazine I've never heard of. Yes, [Drexel University](http://radaronline.com/from-the-magazine/2008/08/worst_colleges_in_america_2008_part_1_05.php) has earned this dubious distinction with a patch of grassland known as the "rape garden." That can't be good.
