I read a humorous article last week regarding the Florida senate outlawing sex with animals. The late night comedy show punchlines were "can you believe sex with animals has been legal in Florida this whole time?"

This week,Â [Southern Fried Science](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=10369) points out that the act outlaws sex with all animals, including humans. The specific statutory language reads:

> A person may not knowingly engage in any sexual conduct or sexual contact with an animal.

Most people who've taken middle school biology will understand that humans are a kind of animal. The act itself fails to define animal, but SFS helpfully includes a chart confirming that human beings are, in fact, animals. For my part, I will now present Betty White rapping about humanity's place in the animal kingdom on the fantastic show Community.
