- We Are Never Ever Getting Back At Leopards

While we’re all enjoying the three weeks during which the federal government is funded, [here’s Paul Kafasis][1] getting hung up on what might be the most important ‘dispatch from a red state’ piece the New York Times has done since the election:

> Earlier this week, I read a New York Times piece on the small Florida town of Marianna, and how it was being affected by the on-going federal government shutdown. The story ended with this quote: “I voted for him, and he’s the one who’s doing this,” she said of Mr. Trump. “I thought he was going to do good things. He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”
> 
> The utter awfulness of that line has been stuck in my head ever since. The initial reaction to this should be obvious: The president of the United States doesn’t need to be hurting anyone. That’s not the job, and if you think it is, something is deeply, sickeningly wrong with you.

And yes, Paul ends with the “leopards eating peoples faces party” tweet.
