By way of Jason Kottke, I enjoyed [A Short Summary of the Contemporary Republican Party's Strategy](https://kottke.org/19/04/a-short-summary-of-the-contemporary-republican-partys-strategy), where he quotes Noam Chomsky on the modern Republican Party coalition between the rich and the religious, white working class was built, decade by decade.

> They have a primary constituency, a real constituency: extreme wealth and corporate power. That's who they have to serve. That's their constituency. You can't get votes that way, so you have to do something else to get votes. What do you do to get votes? This was begun by Richard Nixon with the Southern strategy: try to pick up racists in the South. The mid-1970s, Paul Weyrich, one of the Republican strategists, hit on a brilliant idea. Northern Catholics voted Democratic, tended to vote Democratic, a lot of them working-class. The Republicans could pick up that vote by pretending -- crucially, "pretending" -- to be opposed to abortion. By the same pretense, they could pick up the evangelical vote. Those are big votes -- evangelicals, northern Catholics. Notice the word "pretense." It's crucial. You go back to the 1960s, every leading Republican figure was strongly, what we call now, pro-choice. The Republican Party position was -- that's Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, all the leadership -- their position was: Abortion is not the government's business; it's private business -- government has nothing to say about it. They turned almost on a dime in order to try to pick up a voting base on what are called cultural issues.

> Same with gun rights. Gun rights become a matter of holy writ because you can pick up part of the population that way. In fact, what they've done is put together a coalition of voters based on issues that are basically, you know, tolerable to the establishment, but they don't like it. OK? And they've got to hold that, those two constituencies, together. The real constituency of wealth and corporate power, they're taken care of by the actual legislation.

And then, as a bonus, Kottke tosses in [Cory Doctorow's translation](https://boingboing.net/2019/04/20/useful-idiots-r-us.html) of Chomsky:

> Chomsky lays out the history of the GOP from Nixon's Southern Strategy, when the party figured out that the way to large numbers of working people to vote for policies that made a tiny minority of rich people richer was to quietly support racism, which would fuse together a coalition of racists and the super-rich. By Reagan's time, the coalition was beefed up with throngs of religious fanatics, brought in by adopting brutal anti-abortion policies. Then the GOP recruited paranoid musketfuckers by adopting doctrinal opposition to any form of gun control. Constituency by constituency, the GOP became a big tent for deranged, paranoid, bigoted and misogynist elements, all reliably showing up to vote for policies that would send billions into the pockets of a tiny rump of wealthy people who represented the party's establishment.
