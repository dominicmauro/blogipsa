While I'm listening to the new Girl Talk album, I am occasionally reminded of how superficial my appreciation is.  I also enjoy Tarantino's movies, despite not "getting" them the way [others apparently do](http://metaphilm.com/index.php/detail/reservoir_dogs/).

I had missed this little bit of brilliance in Girl Talk's new album, though:

> “That’s Right” has Beyonce singing “Single Ladies” over the beat from M.O.P’s “Ante Up,” telling you to put a ring on it, and then the vocals cut to M.O.P, telling you to take off your rings and jewelery.
>
> The level of attention this dude puts into his songs is ridiculous.

UPDATE: for the unsophisticated readers like myself: [All Day Samples](http://alldaysamples.com/) describes all the samples in the entire album.
