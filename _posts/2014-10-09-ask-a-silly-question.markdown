At the Online News Association conference, journalists were expressing confusion about how exactly [Facebook decides](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/271889/facebook-is-more-important-to-news-distribution-than-you-think-and-journalists-are-freaked-out/) what posts show up in who’s feed.

> At ONA, anxiety about Facebook’s increasing control over our traffic revealed itself in lots of questions: If I have 250,000 fans of my page, why don’t they all see everything I post? Why does my journalism seem to reach fewer people than it used to? Is Facebook trying to pressure my news organization to spend money to boost my posts or take out ads?

Yes. Next question.
