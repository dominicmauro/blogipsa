Some as-yet unidentified burglars broke into an office building and stole a number of computers and monitors once inside. The computers belonged to a non-profit shelter for victims of sexual violence. When the thieves realized it, they returned the computers with an apology note:

> "We had no idea what we were takeing. Here your stuff back we hope that you guys can continue to make a difference in peoples live. God bless,"

I can't decide if this makes them the worst at being thieves, or the best at being people who are also thieves, or what. It definitely makes them pretty bad writers, but it's heart-warming.
