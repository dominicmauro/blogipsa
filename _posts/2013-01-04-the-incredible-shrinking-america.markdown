In 1800, it took a month and a half to get to Chicago from New York City. My three hour bus ride back home for Christmas would have taken a full week. (Or more, depending on the snow.)

The Mother Nature Network posted [a fun series of maps](http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/stories/how-fast-could-you-travel-across-the-us-in-the-1800s) which show how our country's become smaller as transportation's become faster. In one lifetime, from 1800 to 1857, travel from NYC to Chicago went from six weeks to *two days*. By 1857, those six weeks got you all the way out to Seattle. 

Technology is kickin' rad.
