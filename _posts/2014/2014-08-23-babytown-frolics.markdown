From my favorite newsletter, [NextDraft](http://eepurl.com/1BISH): 

> Attention ridiculous parents: The creator of the Your Baby Can Read program has "[reached a deal](http://nextdraft.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed102783e87fee61c1a534a9d&id=2386e41f8a&e=96822461f3) to settle charges that he and his company made baseless pronouncements about the effectiveness of the program and that they misrepresented scientific studies to prove these bogus statements." 
>
> The program has pulled in more than $185 million over the years. Dr. Robert Titzer is required to pay $300,000 in penalties. Your baby can't read, but they can certainly count well enough to figure out who came out ahead in that deal. 

In a complete and utter coincidence, I'm pleased to announce the launch of my new product, *Your Baby Can Appellate Brief*. Available for the low low price of "The Balance of My Student Loans." Call today!
