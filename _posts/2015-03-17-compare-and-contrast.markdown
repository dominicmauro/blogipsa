Today, Boston’s public radio station WBUR [aired a segment][1] on the recent $7.4 million lawsuit between the copyright owners of *Blurred Lines* and *Got To Give It Up*:

> A lot of composers wondered if copyright is now being extended to cover not just lyrics and melody but a whole vibe. Rhythm. Timbre. This hour On Point: what’s theft now when it comes to music? To song?

It’s a good listen, but the real reason you want to visit WBUR’s web site is for the [side-by-side comparison][2] of songs and the other songs which allegedly ripped them off. Some of these I would have called shameless, before listening.
