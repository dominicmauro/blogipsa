A juror in the George Zimmerman trial, the one who was so quick to hire an agent to land a book deal, did an interview with CNN yesterday. Here, we get some insight into the thought process of the jury in reaching their verdict. [From the transcript](http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/07/15/v-fullstory/3502047/zimmerman-juror-speaks-out-transcript.html):

> COOPER: Do you think [Zimmerman]'s guilty of something?
>
> JUROR: I think he's guilty of not using good judgment.

And really, who isn't guilty of exercising poor judgment once in a while? Oh, if only there were some sort of crime for which we could convict people who exercise poor judgment which results in the death of another. Maybe we could call it [involuntary manslaughter](http://statelaws.findlaw.com/florida-law/florida-involuntary-manslaughter-laws.html) and it could be a concept [literally thousands of years old](http://www.rossgoodmancriminaldefenselawyer.com/2013/06/manslaughter-vs-murder.html). Or something. I'm just spitballing here.
