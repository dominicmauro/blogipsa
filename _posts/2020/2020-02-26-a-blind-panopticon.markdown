I'm more or less unbothered by the COVID-19 outbreak to this point. The boring old regular flu kills more than a half million people every single year, and infects something like a half *billion* folks. To be sure, there are some eyebrow-raising aspects to COVID-19; it appears to be relatively non-life-threatening, but it has killed a number of young and otherwise healthy doctors in China. That strikes me as a little unusual, but a non-zero number of folks between the ages of 25 and 49 die from the regular flu every year. Heck, sometimes, [they're the ones who get the worst of the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/surveillanceqa.htm#12).

Whatever. This is (allegedly) a law blog, so the only bigger waste of time than me opining on the epidemiology of COVID-19 would be you listening to me. I don't understand public health well enough to make heads or tails of the information the CDC and others are publishing about COVID-19.

What I do know is about government data. Zeynep Tufekci uses COVID-19 as a springboard to discuss [the Blindness of Authoritarianism](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/02/coronavirus-and-blindness-authoritarianism/606922/):

> Authoritarian blindness is a perennial problem, especially in large countries like China with centralized, top-down administration. Indeed, Xi would not even be the first Chinese ruler to fall victim to the totality of his own power. On August 4, 1958, buoyed by reports pouring in from around the country of record grain, rice, and peanut production, an exuberant Chairman Mao Zedong wondered how to get rid of the excess, and advised people to eat “five meals a day.” Many did, gorging themselves in the new regime canteens and even dumping massive amounts of “leftovers” down gutters and toilets. Export agreements were made to send tons of food abroad in return for machinery or currency.

> Just months later, perhaps the greatest famine in recorded history began, in which tens of millions would die because, in fact, there was no such surplus. Quite the opposite: The misguided agricultural policies of the Great Leap Forward had caused a collapse in food production. Yet instead of reporting the massive failures, the apparatchiks in various provinces had engaged in competitive exaggeration, reporting ever-increasing surpluses both because they were afraid of reporting bad news and because they wanted to please their superiors.
>
> Mao didn’t know famine was at hand, because he had set up a system that ensured he would hear lies.

You can kind of see how we get from there to modern authoritarian regimes and their response to COVID-19. But Tufekci tells a great story about China's efforts to contain the disease, and their particular version of an autocratic surveillance state. It also seems to rhyme with a lot of the dissembling the President and his closest advisors have been doing.
