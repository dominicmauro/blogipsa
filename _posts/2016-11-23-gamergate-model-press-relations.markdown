A quick piece by Jay Rosen on [The Gamergate model of press relations](http://pressthink.org/2016/11/22/tile/gamergate-model-press-relations/):

> Recently Ben Smith, the editor-in-chief of Buzzfeed’s news operation, wrote: “The big story of 2014 was Gamergate, the misogynistic movement championed by Breitbart and covered primarily by new media. That turned out to be a better predictor of the presidential election than any rubber chicken dinner in Iowa (or poll by a once-reputable pollster).”

> Ben is right. The Gamergate model in press relations posits that high-risk tactics should not be ruled out of consideration. It says that rejection and ridicule by the mainstream media can be a massive plus, because events like these activate — and motivate — your most committed supporters: your trolls. The Gamergate model proposes that transgressing the norms of American democracy is not some crippling defect, as previously believed, but a distinct advantage because the excitement around the transgression recruits new players to the fight, and guarantees the spread of your content.

Rosen coined the phrase "[View From Nowhere](http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/)" to describe the ontological agnosticism of the press. He has also argued that [asymmetry between the major parties fries the circuits of the mainstream press](http://pressthink.org/2016/09/asymmetry-between-the-major-parties-fries-the-circuits-of-the-mainstream-press/). If Rosen is correct here, political campaigns are never going to be the same.
