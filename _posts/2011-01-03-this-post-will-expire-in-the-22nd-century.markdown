Duke Law celebrates Public Domain Day on January 1 of every year, raising public awareness of old creative works for which the copyright has expired.  This is presumably out of a sense of wry irony (henceforth "wryrony"), as nothing in the United States will enter the public domain until 2019.

Read [What Could Have Been Entering the Public Domain on January 1, 2011?](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/pre1976?) on Duke's web site.  For now, we'll just have to thank our lucky stars that we got [Jane Austen](http://www.amazon.com/Pride-Prejudice-Zombies-Classic-Ultraviolent/dp/1594743347).
