Ezra Klein, writing for [Bloomberg.com](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-19/the-future-looks-dull-from-here.html), on how dull the future looks. He walks it back halfway through, saying the course of history can reverse itself quickly: 

> In 2004, a spate of anti-gay-marriage amendments on the ballot in swing states was considered -- perhaps incorrectly -- to have turned out enough conservative voters to re-elect President George W. Bush. Today, same-sex marriage is legal in 16 states, and a 17th -- Illinois -- will legalize it in June. 

Well, that's sobering. I'm calling it now; 2024 is the year of the metric system in America.
