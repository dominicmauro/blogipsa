[A timeline of global media scare stories](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/play/mountains-out-of-molehills/) from Information is Beautiful. I had forgotten about that whole "Swine Flu" thing — it dominates the 'fear' scale pretty handily. The website also notes that while Swine Flu was the deadliest of the scare stories (18,000 fatalities in the last ten years), about 375,000 people die every year from The Flu.  Molehill indeed.
