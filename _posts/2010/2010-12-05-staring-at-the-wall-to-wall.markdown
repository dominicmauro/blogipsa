Jonathan Coulton's song "[Shop Vac](http://www.jonathancoulton.com/wiki/index.php/Shop_Vac)" has received the "typographical music video" treatment.  Actually, that doesn't do the video justice.  Spend the next three minutes watching this.  It's catchy, I promise.

This [Jarrett Heather](http://spaceparanoids.net/) guy has a history of making awesome things from JoCo's music, apparently.
