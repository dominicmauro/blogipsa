> According to Glenn Thrush of Politico, [freshman Congressman Andrew Harris] created a stir at the orientation meeting by demanding to know why he had to wait a month after he was sworn in in January for his government-subsidized health care to kick in. After responding in a huff, he even asked if there was some way he could buy into the government care in advance, seemingly thinking there might be a government program similar to the so-called 'public option' championed by progressive Democrats in 2009.

This would be amusing if he hadn't campaigned so vigorously against socialized healthcare. Now, it's [just embarrassing](http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story).
