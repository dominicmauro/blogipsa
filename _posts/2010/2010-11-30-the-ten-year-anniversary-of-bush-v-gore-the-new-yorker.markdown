The New Yorker's Jeffrey Toobin on [Bush v. Gore](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2000/2000_00_949/) as we approach the tenth anniversary of the decision:

> Momentous Supreme Court cases tend to move quickly into the slipstream of the Courtâ€™s history. In the first ten years after Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision that ended the doctrine of separate but equal in public education, the Justices cited the case more than twenty-five times. In the ten years after Roe v. Wade, the abortion-rights decision of 1973, there were more than sixty-five references to that landmark. 
>
> This month marks ten years since the Court, by a vote of five-to-four, terminated the election of 2000 and delivered the Presidency to George W. Bush. Over that decade, the Justices have provided a verdict of sorts on Bush v. Gore by the number of times they have cited it: zero.
