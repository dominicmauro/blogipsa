Today, I was walking to the library to study after a class in which we finished discussing the [Statute of Limitations](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/post/my-favorite-mnemonic-yet/). A man in front of me on the sidewalk rushed across the street to greet some friends waving to him, but as he darted through one lane stopped traffic, he emerged into very much not-stopped traffic. He was nearly hit by a taxi, but managed to avoid being struck.

I take some solace in the fact that my second thought (after "holy cow, that guy almost got hit by a car!") was "the Statute of Limitations on a personal injury like that is only one year, unless the driver was negligent." You know, because if it were my first thought, I'd have worried that being a lawyer was dehumanizing my worldview.
