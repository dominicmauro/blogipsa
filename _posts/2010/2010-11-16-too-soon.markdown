An unfortunate analogy from a Philadelphia Eagles player, on the intensity with which his team played football on [Monday night](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301115028):

> "The pregame altercation got us going. It had us ready. We came back into the locker room pumped," Jackson said. "**We were like pit bulls, ready to get out of the cage**."

It appears there's no such thing as vickpalm.jpg â€” have a picardpalm.jpg instead. (With bonus rikerpalm.jpg action!)
