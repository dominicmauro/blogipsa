If you're not familiar with the legal challenge of a California law, the New York Times has a [nice summary](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/us/03scotus.html) of both the law and last week's oral argument. I prefer the [Ars Technica commentary](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/11/oral-arguments-in-violent-game-case-focus-on-nature-of-violence.ars), if for no other reason than it features a section titled "The Vulcan Defense."

But if words not-in-bubbles are not your forte, try The Escapist's [Critical Miss: Trolling for Justice](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/comics/critical-miss/8299-Critical-Miss-Trolling-for-Justice).

When Justice Scalia is the voice of reason, and you're invoking the Vulcan defense, I think you should have just stayed in bed.
