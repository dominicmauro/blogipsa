It's not the world's most accurate resource on lots of things, I'll concede. But do you know how much a subscription to Helicopter Prison Escape Quarterly costs? It's not worth the expense, in my expert opinion. Just go read [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes). My favorite on the list is Pascal Payet, who has apparently escaped from prison in a helicopter three(!) times.

Just think of the Wikipedia articles in fifty years: the [List of Jetpack Prison Escapes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_jetpack_prison_escapes) is waiting for us, in _the future_.
