[The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2010/08/11/GR2010081106717.html):

> The Republicans' plan to extend the Bush administration tax cuts for the wealthy would cost $36.6 billion more than the Democrats' plan, which extends cuts only for families making less than $250,000 a year and individuals making less than $200,000.

The difference looks negligible until you scroll down. Won't somebody think of the millionaires?
