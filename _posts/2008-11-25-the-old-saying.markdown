The news story "[rapist who acted as his own lawyer gets maximum sentence][1]" may do a lot of things for an average reader. It can highlight the importance of effective legal representation. It can also highlight the importance of not raping people. For me, it's an opportunity for jokes.

Because you know what they say...

"He who represents himself has a rapist for a lawyer!" No, hang on. "He who rapes his lawyer has to represent himself." Wait, wait, I've got it. "He who has no lawyer has raped himself." No, the second one was better. 

Yes, that was inappropriate. But he has 156 years to write me a letter about how out of line I was.
