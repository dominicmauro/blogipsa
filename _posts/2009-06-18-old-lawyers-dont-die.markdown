Having polished off a very engrossing [biography of Alexander Hamilton](http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/B000UENRQU/), I have begun to read the biography of another famous American thinker, writer, and jurist: [Judge Learned Hand](http://www.amazon.com/Learned-Hand-Judge-Gerald-Gunther/dp/0674518802/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1245123272&sr=1-1). The first thing I found out is that his name wasn't actually Learned, but Billings. Had his name been Billable, I guess he never would have made it to the bench. (Please, folks, tip your waitress!)

So in 1907, Learned Hand is considering leaving a big law firm on Wall Street in hopes of becoming a judge. His father-in-law, aware of how poorly judges are paid compared to high-powered attorneys at law, attempts to dissuade the young Hand. When Hand makes clear that he intends to be a judge, his father-in-law finally relents, promising to support Mr. and Mrs. Hand, even after his death. He writes:

> "It's up to me to add ultimately to the family store _when my life's action has been dismissed with costs_..."

See? Old lawyers don't die, they just get their motions denied, and are remanded for further proceedings in a higher court.
