Microsoft and Apple are in a kerfuffle over the right to use the phrase "App Store" in conjunction with selling programs for mobile devices. This is a fight between two global electronics companies, which is to say that I don't really care who wins.

But the way the fight is playing out is hilarious: Microsoft wants Apple to have to [re-write its latest brief](http://www.geekwire.com/2011/microsoft-seeks-toss-apple-app-store-font-big) to the judge because _the font Apple used was too small_. I actually had to re-submit a brief in my legal writing class because I used improper margins, so I can sympathize with Apple here. Except not so much, because I didn't have $60 billion in cash just lying around.
