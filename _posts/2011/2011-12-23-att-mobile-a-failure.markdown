History is full of tragic loves. Cleopatra and Marc Antony. Elizabeth Taylor and like half of Hollywood. Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. Now, the failed marriage of AT&T; and T-Mobile. AT&T; had [this](http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=22146&cdvn;=news&newsarticleid;=33560&mapcode;=corporate%7Cwireless-networks-general) to say for itself:

> "The actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice to block this transaction do not change the realities of the U.S. wireless industry. It is one of the most fiercely competitive industries in the world, with a mounting need for more spectrum that has not diminished and must be addressed immediately. The AT&T; and T-Mobile USA combination would have offered an interim solution to this spectrum shortage. In the absence of such steps, customers will be harmed and needed investment will be stifled."

This is one of the stupidest things I've ever read. "There's lots of competition in the wireless industry. (ED: *snort*) We were trying to put an end to that, but you guys are being jerks about it. We're taking our legal team and going home."
