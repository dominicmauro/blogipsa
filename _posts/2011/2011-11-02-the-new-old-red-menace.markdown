One of the leading candidates for the Republican nomination for the Presidential race in 2012 says China is developing nuclear capability.

[Herman Cain on China](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-china-trying-develop-nuclear-weap/):

>[W]e already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes, they're a military threat. _They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability_, and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat."

Boy, I sure hope China never ends up with the bomb. Just think what that would do to the Eastern Hemisphere! Why, it's as unthinkable as a Soviet Russia without Kruschev.
