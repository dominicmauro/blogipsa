[Herman Cain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df8xgvhz_0E), Constitutional scholar and Presidential hopeful:

> "We don’t need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States of America, we need to reread the Constitution and enforce the Constitution. … And I know that there are some people that are not going to do that, so for the benefit of those who are not going to read it because they don’t want us to go by the Constitution, there’s a little section in there that talks about ‘**life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness**.’"

The "little section" he's talking about is in the [Declaration of Independence](http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_transcript.html), not the Constitution. Because otherwise, this wouldn't be funny.
