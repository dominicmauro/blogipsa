DDoS attacks are kind of funny examples. A regular DoS attack leverages technology to let one person be a sit-in. That's like being the only guy at a sit-in, but bringing a bunch of mannequins to clog up the business. That's less an "exercise of free speech" and more "being that guy with a big backpack the waitress keeps tripping over."

But a DDoS is more analogous to a bunch of people denying easy access to a lunch counter; at least until you start considering [federal laws prohibiting unauthorized access to computer systems](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/post/the-indictment-of-aaron-swartz/). The other thing to recall is that the people protesting at those lunch counters were convicted of trespassing and unauthorized blackness or whatever the stupid Jim Crow laws prohibited. 

With the benefit of hindsight and an enlightened 21st Century perspective, we see now that the protesters were morally superior. But in Alabama in the 1950s, the guys behind the analog denial of service attacks [went to jail](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/resources/article/annotated_letter_from_birmingham/).
