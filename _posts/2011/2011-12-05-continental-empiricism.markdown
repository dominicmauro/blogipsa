[Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2011/12/03/swiss-govt-study-downloadin.html) on a Swiss study about the effects of pirating movies and music:

> The independent study concluded that downloaders use the money they spend to buy more legitimate entertainment products. So they've concluded to maintain Switzerland's extant copyright law, which makes downloading for personal use legal.

It's short and links to the study itself, which is anything but neutral on the topic of downloading.
