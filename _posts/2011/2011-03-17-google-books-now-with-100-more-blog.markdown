I think I accomplished a lot of things in law school. However, I may be most proud of [The Public Index](http://thepublicindex.org), a leading resource for information about the [Google Book Search Settlement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Book_Search_Settlement_Agreement). I worked for Professor [James Grimmelmann](http://laboratorium.net/) and alongside a [great team of students](http://thepublicindex.org/about).

As of today, The Public Index has aÂ [blog](http://blog.thepublicindex.org/), where the team provides updates on works of scholarship and foreign lawsuits related to digitization. It belongs in everyone's RSS feeds.
