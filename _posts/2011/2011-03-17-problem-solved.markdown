Well, that was easy. [House Republicans Vote That Earth Is Not Warming](http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode.cfm?id=house-repubs-vote-that-earth-is-not-11-03-16):

> Congress has finally acted on global warming—by denying it exists. It’s in the grand lawmaking tradition of the Indiana state legislature’s 1897 attempt to [redefine the value of pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill).
>
> **All Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted against an amendment that states that global warming exists, regardless of cause.**
>
> The Republican-led House of Representatives is currently working on the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011, which would bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide emissions to mitigate climate change.
