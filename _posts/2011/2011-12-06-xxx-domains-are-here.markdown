I never thought I would see the day when pornography would be on the internet. From [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/6/2615066/xxx-domains-general-sale):

> Following a couple of months of pre-sales, adult-industry-centric .xxx domains will go on general sale at 11:00AM ET / 9:00AM PT / 4:00PM GMT today. ICM reports that over 50,000 .xxx domains have been pre-registered, with around 100,000 more names up for grabs from the general sale.

The Verge also reported on the lawsuit between [porn industry giants](http://www.theverge.com/web/2011/11/21/2578199/porn-lawsuit-xxx-domains) and the registrar for the new .xxx domains. While the cost of a regular .com domain is just about $10 a year, and registrars have many registries to work with, the .xxx domain has a single registry. That's kind of steep, I guess, but I'm sure they wouldn't take advantage of the–

$60 dollars a domain? And GoDaddy is charging $99 to registrants? Wow, no wonder they're upset. Fortunately, my new domain, extremelynakedpeople.xxx, is not taken. Unfortunately, it's going to take me a while to find enough change in the couch cushions to pay the $99 registration fee. Heck, for that price, I could pay for BarelyLegally.com for the next decade.

So when do you think the first pornography will start being uploaded to the internet? That's going to be kind of a weird adjustment.
