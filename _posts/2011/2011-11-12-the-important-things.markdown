Oh, sure. I'm sick, convalescing in bed, and ESPN doesn't have the decency to talk about anything but the Penn State child rape thing. They don't even have anything insightful to say, they just know they need to have talking heads talk about it... headfully.

How hard is it to come up with something intelligent to say about the situation? For instance, I wonder if you can sue folks that know your kid is being sexually assaulted, but who fail to report it. As ever, Legal As She Is Spoke has me covered. [Get your fix](http://www.lasisblog.com/2011/11/11/the-odds-of-sanduskyâ€™s-victims-successfully-suing-joepa/) and find out whether Joe Paterno is liable for forgetting to call the cops.

Because that's what lawyers focus on, right? The important things, like who's getting slapped with a lawsuit in all this.
