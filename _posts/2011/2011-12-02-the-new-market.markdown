Professor Susan Crawford, of Cardozo Law School and about a million other great places:

> So now what we’ve got is no competition and no regulatory oversight. Wireless is not substitutable for the kind of wireline Internet access that Comcast and TWC can provide. These are two separate enormous markets, each controlled by a couple of mammoth players. What’s at stake? Everything about the future of information in America.

She calls the blog post "[Smug and Chagrined](http://scrawford.net/blog/smug-and-chagrined/1548/)," which is how she feels as she watches Comcast and Verizon carve up the market like so much roast beast. Smug for having called it, and presumably chagrined for watching the internet service market cornered by a limp-wristed version of a trust. 

I'll be preordering her book on this whole mess, and probably sob quietly as I read it.
