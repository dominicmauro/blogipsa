From [Wired](http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/12/livestream-super-bowl/)

> In February, Super Bowl XLVI will be the first instance of the biggest game of the year to stream live over the web, via NFL.com and NBCSports.com. The game will also be available to stream on Verizon smartphones through the league’s wireless partner’s NFL Mobile app. (If you’re on another wireless carrier, you’re out of luck; Verizon’s got the exclusive.)

Awesome. Every day, we get a little bit closer to that glorious future when first-run TV happens on the internet, instead of just pirated first-run TV happening on the internet. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful for Netflix Instant and Hulu and South Park Studios and all that other good stuff.
