The New York Criminal Law and Procedure blog tries to answer [what is the "interest of justice"](http://www.nycrimblog.com/nycrim/2011/07/what-is-the-interest-of-justice-anyway.html)? Courts in New York are authorized by the [Criminal Procedure Law](http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=@LLCPL+&LIST=LAW+&BROWSER=BROWSER+&TOKEN=28308976+&TARGET=VIEW) to disregard certain rules only in the interest of justice, but it's undefined and (I think) rather vague.

Larry Cunningham took a stab at it in an [article about the appeals process](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1892465). It's a good read, and you really don't want to be outside on the East Coast right now, anyway.
