By way of the best Intellectual Property newsletter you’re probably not reading, [Five Useful Articles](http://tinyletter.com/5ua/letters/this-circuit-goes-to-eleven-5-useful-articles-vol-2-issue-5), a tale search engine optimization, but not the kind you’re used to:

> Google has announced some changes to its search algorithm aimed at making "pirate sites" slightly harder to find, either by pushing them down further in the results or by removing words associated with them from the autocomplete feature. Experts predict that the movie and music industries will be totally satisfied with these efforts and stop scapegoating the search company for every perceived dip in possible revenues in markets real or imagined.
>
> Just kidding! Presumably those industry groups will not be satisfied until searching for the title of a film—say 2005's Will Smith classic Hitch, a favorite film of approximately 50% of the Five Useful Articles team—produces a blank page and automatically dings your credit card for $3.50. 

Seriously, Sarah Jeong and Parker Higgins write this (almost) week, and it’s always hilarious. Easily my favorite newsletter.
