A guy named Gilberto Sanchez claims he bought a pre-release copy of the Wolverine movie back in 2009, and uploaded it to popular file-sharing site MegaUpload. (MegaUpload is the one that's currently in the crosshairs of SOPA, and claims it's not a bad actor. This has pretty lousy timing.) His punishment? [A year in jail](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/x-men-wolverine-pirate-sentenced-hugh-jackman-275453):

> "Although Fox was able to get defendant's Wolverine workprint removed from his Megaupload account within approximately one day, by then, the damage was done and the film had proliferated like wildfire throughout the Internet, resulting in up to millions of infringements," prosecutors said in court documents.

I think the real tragedy here is that millions of people might have sat through this movie. Those poor souls.
