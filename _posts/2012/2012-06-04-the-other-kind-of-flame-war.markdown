The Chief Research Officer for F-Secure, an antivirus firm, has written about the newest confirmed tool in America's cyberwarfare arsenal, Flame. He says:

> Antivirus systems need to strike a balance between detecting all possible attacks without causing any false alarms. And while we try to improve on this all the time, there will never be a solution that is 100 percent perfect. The best available protection against serious targeted attacks requires a layered defense, with network intrusion detection systems, whitelisting against known malware and active monitoring of inbound and outbound traffic of an organization’s network.

> This story does not end with Flame. It’s highly likely there are other similar attacks already underway that we haven’t detected yet. Put simply, attacks like these work. Flame was a failure for the antivirus industry. We really should have been able to do better. But we didn’t. **We were out of our league, in our own game.**

[Read the rest at Ars](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/06/why-antivirus-companies-like-mine-failed-to-catch-flame-and-stuxnet/). It's not a boilerplate mea culpa, at least. The authors of Flame used very sophisticated methods with zero-day exploits, including spoofing Microsoft's signature on security certificates. There's nothing on the planet that can reliably keep your system safe from that sort of thing, and he admits it. I can't quite decide if that's refreshing, scary, or both.

If you're not up to date on what Flame is, there's a nice [post in Wired all about it](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/05/flame/all/1?utm_source=Contextly&utm;_medium=RelatedLinks&utm;_campaign=Previous).
