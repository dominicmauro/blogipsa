You really really ought to be reading [Abnormal Use](http://abnormaluse.com/2012/01/the-case-of-the-killer-toothbrush.html): The Case of the Killer Toothbrush is afoot!

> According to this report by CBC News out of British Columbia, a woman named Saliha Alnoor is suing the Colgate-Palmolive Company for injuries she sustained when her toothbrush allegedly broke in two places in her mouth, slicing her gums and causing her to lose consciousness.
>
> Alnoor apparently hired an engineer, who has done extensive testing on the toothbrush and determined that it contains a design defect that caused the brush to break.

She called Colgate to complain, and they sent her a $20 coupon. What, for more toothbrushes? So she can stab her gums over and over again?

Ms. Alnoor did the only sensible thing. She moved on with her life like a well-adjusted adult filed a lawsuit. No, really. Thankfully, she couldn't find a lawyer willing to take this case, so no one can use this as ammo in their "I hate lawyers so much argh" Facebook posts. She's pro se, baby: doing all her own lawyering.

I would conjecture that she couldn't find a lawyer willing to take this case, because it's stupid. How exactly does she plan to convince a jury that she was brushing her teeth like a normal human being when the brush just exploded in her mouth? 

Frankly, my gums hurt just imagining how much torque she must have been applying in her brushstrokes to achieve such catastrophic failure that she needed [$6,000 of dental work](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/01/03/bc-broken-toothbrush-lawsuit.html) to repair the damage. Whether the damage came from the broken brush, or her "scrub away all the enamel" technique, is an exercise left to the reader. And also a jury, I guess.
