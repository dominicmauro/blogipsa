Oslo man's financial records briefly accessible to all after Norwegian tax website crashes:

> In late 2003, the Norwegian government launched Altinn: a web portal that allowed its citizens to access and submit government forms online, as well as get their personal tax information when filing season rolled around. However, users hoping to get an early start on their taxes this year were in for a serious surprise, as Altinn crashed when an influx of Norwegians attempted to access their info. 
>
> The service was restored a few hours later, but only a sole individual's personal information was available â€” and anyone trying to access the site could see it. Icrontic is reporting that the individual in question is "Kenneth," a 36-year-old man from Oslo. Aside from his own tax information from the last two years being made public, his wife's details, as well as information about his employer, were accessible.
