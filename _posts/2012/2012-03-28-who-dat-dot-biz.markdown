Once in a generation, a visionary creates something truly revolutionary. A product that upends whole sectors of the population. A service that brings grown men to gnash their teeth and women wail in sorrow, all because they had not thought of it first.

Or, sometimes, someone makes a web site with hilariously oversized text, and sticks a [WHOIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois) search form at the bottom. This person also might call it "The Facebook of Websites." Ladies and gentlemen, I give you [WhoDat.biz](http://whodat.biz) â€“ the world's first way to look up WHOIS data.

This is apparently the first product from Kanye West's fabulous new design startup, DONDA. You might recall that time a couple months ago when Kanye went on a two hour non-stop [Tweeting binge](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/kanye-wests-bizarre-twitter-rant-is-about-his-ins). Ideally, this isn't what he was so excited about. 

**UPDATE**: It's a [faaaaaaaake](http://gizmodo.com/5897201/this-new-donda-media-site-is-fake-as-hell). Well played, clerks. Well played.
