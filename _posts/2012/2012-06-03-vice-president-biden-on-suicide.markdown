VP Biden, [talking with a support group](http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view/20120528joe_biden_reflects_on_losing_wife_daughter/srvc=home&position;=recent) for friends and families of military service members killed in action. Biden's wife and daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972, and he understandably went through some dark thoughts afterwards. You know, for being [The Onion's](http://www.theonion.com/articles/biden-receives-lifetime-ban-from-dave-busters,17285/) [favorite target](http://www.theonion.com/articles/shirtless-biden-washes-trans-am-in-white-house-dri,2718/) (and not undeservedly so; the guy does say [some interesting things](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/26/the-never-ending-list-of-vice-president-joe-biden-s-verbal-gaffes.html)), this is actually really touching and poignant.
