Apparently, burglars don't bother stealing CDs and DVDs anymore.

> “Years ago, you’d see a man in a pub selling CDs,” says Eric Phelps, a detective in London’s Metropolitan Police. “Not any more.” Indeed, thefts of entertainment products like CDs and DVDs have collapsed in England and Wales, to the point that they are now taken in just 7% of all burglaries in which something is stolen (see chart). They are now targeted no more frequently than are toiletries and cigarettes.

Read the rest at [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21542438). The story is a funny and odd footnote in the saga of Media in the Digital Age. Music is legitimately on Amazon, iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, and about a billion other places. So I guess I can see why CDs don't get stolen very much anymore.

As for movies, well, they're on Netflix... [eventually](http://blog.ipsaloquitur.org/post/28-days-laterer/). Seriously, if you can't even sell stolen DVDs, I wonder why Hollywood thinks you can still sell them for $20 in a store. It's okay. Ultraviolet is [totally gaining momentum, guys](http://parislemon.com/post/15647447004/more-like-mehviolet). Any day now. Aaaaaany day.
