Marco Arment on piracy in the digital age, by way of an absurdly intuitive example I'm stealing immediately to explain to everyone I know.

> Relying solely on yelling about what’s right isn’t a pragmatic approach for the media industry to take. And it’s not working. It’s unrealistic and naïve to expect everyone to do the “right” thing when the alternative is so much easier, faster, cheaper, and better for so many of them.

Read [Right versus pragmatic](http://www.marco.org/2012/02/25/right-vs-pragmatic) at Marco.org. I should probably stop trying to explain this stuff, and just link to his post every time it comes up.
