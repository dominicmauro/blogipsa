Bump is a smartphone app that transfers a user's contact information from one phone to another by fist-bumping. Over the years, Bump has added things like photo sharing to their program, and today they've let me do something I've always wanted.

Now I can [fist-bump my computer](https://photos.bu.mp/) to upload photos. I'm not even going to use it, I just love how inventive it is.
