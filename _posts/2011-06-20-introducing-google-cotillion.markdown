Yesterday, on Father's Day, Google automatically added a reminder for users to call their fathers via the Gmail web site. We pick up the resulting scandal from [Tech Crunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/‘reminder-call-dad-another-notch-in-googles-belt-of-social-fail/):

> Albeit micro, ‘Reminder: Call dad’ is just one more example of Google not entirely grasping social niceties. It should be obvious that putting up a status message that’s offensive to some users especially users whose fathers have passed away, or were abusive, et al., in a place that most people consider private, might not go over well.  But it wasn’t.

Notwithstanding the bit about folks' fathers who have just passed away, because that is inarguably sad; I'm going to post a link to Louis C.K.'s sketch about [White People Problems](http://comedians.jokes.com/louis-c-k-/videos/uncensored---louis-c-k----white-people-problems) and make one smartass comment myself.

The giant international corporation that indexes a startling approximation of the sum total of human knowledge and makes it available for free on a global information network **does not entirely grasp social niceties**. Everything is ruined forever.
