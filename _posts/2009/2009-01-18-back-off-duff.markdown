I don't graduate until May of 2010, so the term "almost legally" is quite apt for what I'm doing here. However, when I graduate and pass the bar exam, I'll have to come up with another name for the site. The most logical one, of course, is to move from "almost" to "barely" legally. It only makes sense.

But Hillary Duff is once again [trying to upstage me](http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/cc_insider/2009/01/hillary-duff-to-be-in-barely-legal-not-the-nudie-magazine.html): I will not stand for this duffspiracy.
